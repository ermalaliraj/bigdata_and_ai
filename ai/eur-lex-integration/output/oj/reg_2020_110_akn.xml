It states that the number of EU citizens living and working in Member States other than that of their nationality is increasing but that due to the barriers and obstacles in the exercise of their voting rights in their country of residence they often feel unrepresented in local politics. According to the annex, &apos;the low turnout of mobile EU citizens in local and European elections is not surprising, since they are still only given the right to vote in municipal and European elections in their country of residence but are excluded from the elections and democratic choices which really count&apos;. The proposed initiative therefore strives to &apos;make European citizenship a real citizenship&apos;, &apos;to take a step towards universal suffrage&apos; by giving EU citizens full political rights, &apos;to encourage better integration&apos; and &apos;to help build a transnational European democracy&apos;.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d131e129"><num>(3)</num><p>The organisers have submitted additional information in the form of a brochure.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d131e135"><num>(4)</num><p>The Treaty on European Union (TEU) reinforces citizenship of the Union and enhances further the democratic functioning of the Union by providing, inter alia, that every citizen is to have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union by way of a European citizens&apos; initiative.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d131e141"><num>(5)</num><p>To this end, the procedures and conditions required for the citizens&apos; initiative should be clear, simple, user-friendly and proportionate to the nature of the citizens&apos; initiative so as to encourage participation by citizens and to make the Union more accessible.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d131e148"><num>(6)</num><p>As regards the objective quoted in paragraph 1 under the first bullet point, notably to &apos;remove barriers to registration of EU citizens to vote and stand in European and local elections either in their country of residence or origin&apos;, the Commission would have the competence to adopt a proposal for a legal act of the Union in that area on the basis of Article 22 TFEU.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d131e158"><num>(7)</num><p>As regards the objective quoted in paragraph 1 under the second bullet point, notably to &apos;reaffirm Universal Suffrage as a fundamental right and value.
