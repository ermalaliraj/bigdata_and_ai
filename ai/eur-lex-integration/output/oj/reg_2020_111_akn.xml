The Annex to that Implementing Decision demarcates and lists certain areas of the Member States concerned in Parts I to IV thereof, differentiated by the level of risk based on the epidemiological situation as regards that disease. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU has been amended several times to take account of changes in the epidemiological situation in the Union as regards African swine fever that need to be reflected in that Annex. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU was last amended by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/291<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5"><p>Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/291 of 28 February 2020 amending the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU concerning animal health control measures relating to African swine fever in certain Member States (OJ L 61, 2.3.2020, p. 9).</p></authorialNote>, following instances of African swine fever in pigs in Poland and Hungary.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d132e126"><num>(2)</num><p>Council Directive 2002/60/EC<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6"><p>Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever and amending Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease and African swine fever (OJ L 192, 20.7.2002, p. 27).</p></authorialNote> lays down the minimum Union measures to be taken for the control of African swine fever. In particular, Article 9 of Directive 2002/60/EC provides for the establishment of a protection zone and a surveillance zone when African swine fever has been officially confirmed in pigs on a holding, and Articles 10 and 11 of that Directive lay down the measures to be taken in the protection and surveillance zones in order to prevent the spread of that disease. Recent experience has shown that the measures laid down in Directive 2002/60/EC are effective in controlling the spread of that disease, and in particular the measures providing for the cleaning and disinfecting of infected holdings and other measures related to the eradication of that disease.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d132e142"><num>(3)</num><p>Since the date of adoption of Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/291, there has been a new case of African swine fever in a feral pig in Romania, and there have also been new cases of that disease in feral pigs in Poland.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d132e149"><num>(4)</num><p>In March 2020, a case of African swine fever in a feral pig was observed in the county of Suceava in Romania in an area currently listed in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU.
