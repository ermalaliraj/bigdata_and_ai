for the renewal of the authorisation for chickens for fattening, minor avian species for fattening, laying hens, minor avian species for laying, weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, minor porcine species (weaned) and for fattening, all fish and shrimp, and for a new authorisation for chickens reared for laying and for breeding purposes, for ornamental birds and other non-food producing birds, for turkeys for fattening, for turkeys reared for breeding purposes, for turkeys for breeding purposes, for chickens for breeding purposes and related minor poultry species and other ornamental and non-food producing birds, for suckling piglets and related minor porcine species, for all crustaceans, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category &apos;zootechnical

The Authority confirmed its previous conclusions that <i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i> CNCM I-4622 is considered safe for the target species, consumers of products from animals fed with the additive and the environment. It also concluded that there is a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation and that no conclusion could be drawn on the potential for skin and eyes irritancy and dermal sensitisation. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive. It also concluded that the additive is efficacious for chickens reared for laying, chickens reared for breeding, chickens for breeding, turkeys and minor avian species reared for laying/breeding and for breeding, and for suckling piglets and minor porcine species for breeding and for fattening and all crustaceans.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d148e211"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of <i>Pediococcus acidilactici</i> CNCM I-4622 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
