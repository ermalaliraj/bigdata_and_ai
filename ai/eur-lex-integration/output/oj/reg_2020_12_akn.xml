The Annex to that Implementing Decision demarcates and lists certain areas of the Member States concerned in Parts I to IV thereof, differentiated by the level of risk based on the epidemiological situation as regards that disease. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU has been amended several times to take account of changes in the epidemiological situation in the Union as regards African swine fever that need to be reflected in that Annex.

Taking into account the current epidemiological situation in the Union, regionalisation in those three Member States has been reassessed and updated. In addition, the risk management measures in place also have been reassessed and updated.

These cases of African swine fever in feral pigs constitute an increased level of risk which should be reflected in that Annex. Accordingly, these areas of Poland listed in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU that are in close proximity to areas listed in Part II affected by these recent cases of African swine fever should now be listed in Part II of that Annex instead of in Part I thereof.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d13e145"><num>(5)</num><p>In late December 2019, several cases of African swine fever in feral pigs were also observed in the counties of Békés, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok and Hajdú-Bihar in Hungary in areas currently listed in Part II of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU, located in close proximity to areas listed in Part I thereof.

Accordingly, this area of Bulgaria affected by African swine fever should now be listed in Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU instead of in Part II thereof. Given that Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU lists the areas where the epidemiological situation is still evolving and very dynamic, when any amendments are made to areas listed in that Part, particular consideration must always be given to the effect on the surrounding areas, as has been done in this instance.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d13e157"><num>(7)</num><p>In order to take account of recent developments in the epidemiological evolution of African swine fever in the Union, and in order to combat the risks associated with the spread of that disease in a proactive manner, new high-risk areas of a sufficient size should be demarcated for Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria and duly listed in Parts I, II and III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU.
