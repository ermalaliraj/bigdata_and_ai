In particular, the supply chain of certain types of PPE such as the disposable face masks is under severe strain, due to the exponential growth of the demand both via existing as well as via new channels. In addition, the global supply chain of such products has also sustained significant disruptions, which have induced repercussions on the EU market as well.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d154e70"><num>(2)</num><p>Bearing in mind that the health and safety of the EU citizens is of upmost priority, it is of paramount importance to ensure that the most appropriate PPE and medical devices ensuring adequate protection are swiftly made available to those who need it most.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d154e76"><num>(3)</num><p>Economic operators active across the EU are working relentlessly to increase their respective manufacturing and distribution capacity.

Notified bodies need to carry out this assessment not only where the manufacturer has applied the harmonised standards, but also in a situation where the manufacturer has followed other technical solutions. When delivering the conformity assessment certificates, notified bodies are required to inform their notifying authorities and may also be required to inform other notified bodies of the certificates they have issued, as set out in Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2016/425.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d154e239"><num>(22)</num><p>Notified bodies should thus assess whether products manufactured in line with other technical solutions, such as the ones contained in the WHO recommendations on the appropriate selection of PPE also meet the applicable essential health and safety requirements.
