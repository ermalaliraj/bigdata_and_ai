ZnO prevents the propensity of ZPT to transchelate with other metal ions, typically iron and calcium, and to form coloured complexes that lead to an unwanted change in colour of the paint. In combinations with BIT, ZnO prevents it from moving from the water phase to the organic phase of paints (e.g. the binder) thus increasing its availability in the water phase where the risk for microbial growth is higher. Without ZnO the paint life-time would be reduced to a few weeks, also reducing its shelf life.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e167"><num>(9)</num><p>Decision 2014/312/EU already allows the use of ZPT for the three functions: as in-can preservative, as tinting machine preservative and as dry-film preservative, up to a concentration of 0,05 %, and allows the use of BIT at a concentration of 0,05 % in the final, ready to use, product. It seems therefore appropriate to allow also the use of stabiliser ZnO for the same applications.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e174"><num>(10)</num><p>Where ZnO is used to stabilise &apos;in-can&apos; or &apos;tinting paste&apos; preservation combinations, impacts on the environment are expected to be lower than where used in dry-film preservation combinations, (already derogated within the current criteria), as a typical dose of ZPT for a dry-film preservation application of an outdoor paint would be approximately 10 times higher in magnitude in comparison to that needed for indoor in-can preservation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e188"><num>(11)</num><p>Alternatives in use by manufacturers, in the form of other preservation combinations that would not need ZnO for stabilisation purposes, mostly use MIT (2-methyl-2H-isothiazol-3one). However, according to the third paragraph of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1480<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4"><p>Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1480 of 4 October 2018 amending, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical and scientific progress, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures and correcting Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/776 (OJ L 251, 5.10.2018, p. 1).</p></authorialNote>, as of 1 May 2020 MIT will be classified, inter alia, as Skin Sens 1A with the Hazard statement Code H317 (may cause an allergic skin reaction). This will trigger the hazard classification Skin Sens 1A with the Hazard Statement Code H317 also for the final paint products in which MIT will be used at or above a concentration of 15 ppm. Current scientific research shows that MIT is not effective, as a preservative, if used in concentrations below 15 ppm.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e207"><num>(12)</num><p>ZPT, BIT or their combinations are considered the other viable options to replace MIT, but they will be requiring the use of ZnO in all its possible applications.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e213"><num>(13)</num><p>Therefore, it is not technically feasible to substitute ZnO.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e219"><num>(14)</num><p>Data provided by stakeholders prove that in order to achieve sufficient stabilisation performance, up to 0,030 % ZnO is needed for in-can and tinting preservation combinations containing ZPT while 0,010-0,040 % ZnO is needed in combinations with BIT.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e225"><num>(15)</num><p>Decision 2014/312/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d164e231"><num>(16)</num><p>The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 66/2010,</p></recital></recitals><formula name="enactingFormula"><p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:</p></formula></preamble><body><article xml:id="art_d164e241" leos:compliant="false"><num>Sole Article</num><heading/><paragraph><content><p>In the Appendix to Decision 2014/312/EU, in the section headed &apos;1.
