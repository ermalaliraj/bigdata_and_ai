Therefore, upon initiation, the Commission asked the 13 parties to reply to sampling questions and, subsequently, to reply to a couple of other questions destined to clarify their role and exact activities.

These service centres did not have any hot-rolling or cold-rolling facilities and therefore did not qualify as a producer of the product concerned. In addition, their added value was minor in relation to the cost of their inputs.

They claimed the present investigation covers two different types of stainless steel coils, namely white and black coils, and that although both black and white coils are classified under the same HS codes (as defined in the Notice of Initiation), their properties and intended uses differ. With regard to physical and chemical properties, Marcegaglia, inter alia, argued that black coils are, in terms of corrosion resistance, not even stainless steel products. According to Marcegaglia they are semi-finished products, neither annealed nor pickled.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e807"><num>(40)</num><p>Moreover, according to Marcegaglia, black SSHR are made by hot rolling of slabs and they are mainly, if not exclusively, supplied to re-rollers. Marcegaglia argued that black SSHR can in fact only be used for further processing (re-rolling) into pickled coils or stainless steel cold-rolled coils and that there are only two re-rollers in the Union, namely Marcegaglia and another much smaller party. It claimed that black SSHR, as product category, is more similar to stainless steel slabs than to white SSHR due to its intrinsic nature of semi-finished product.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e813"><num>(41)</num><p>Further according to Marcegaglia, white SSHR are a stainless steel finished product made by annealing and pickling of black SSHR. The latter are therefore the indispensable raw material to manufacture white SSHR to the same extent as slabs are the indispensable raw material to manufacture black SSHR. As such, white SSHR can be used without further processing by end-users for direct industrial application (e.g. automotive, machinery and petrochemical industries). It is supplied to plate cutting companies, tube manufacturers and cold rolling companies for further processing.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e819"><num>(42)</num><p>Finally, the parties concerned claimed that the Union industry is not interested in supplying the market with black coils as they rather use themselves the black coils they produce for further conversion into white coils and further downstream products. Therefore, according to them, the security of supply of black coils is at stake if they wouldbe included in the scope of measures, if any.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e825"><num>(43)</num><p>Eurofer opposed the claims referred to in recitals (39) to (42). It, inter alia, insisted that black and white coils are both flat stainless steel products with the same physical characteristics and chemical composition for the same grades, manufactured from the same raw materials (essentially chromium, stainless steel scrap and nickel) and that the added value for processing black coils into white coils is limited and represents less than 8 % of the production cost of a white coil. Eurofer also referred to an overall unused capacity of more than 2 million tonnes among Union producers and indicated that the Union industry can and is willing to satisfy the entire demand of SSHR on the Union market, regardless of the product type needed. Moreover, it submitted that several Union producers notified on their websites that they are capable and willing to deliver black coils. Consequently, it argued that the security of supply of black coils is not at risk but pointed at the risk of circumvention if black coils would be excluded.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e831"><num>(44)</num><p>The Commission analysed the claims. On the product characteristics, the investigation found that black coils and white coils have the same chemical composition. In particular, black coils are manufactured from the same basic material and thus have the same characteristics as white coils depending on the steel grade. It follows that black coils fall under the same Combined Nomenclature headings as the white coils covered by the proceeding, starting with 7219 or 7220. These headings both fall under the Section &apos;stainless steel&apos; in Chapter 72 (Iron and Steel) of the Combined Nomenclature. Black and white coils also have the same physical properties as they have similar dimensions. Black and white coils are interchangeable for re-rollers with annealing and pickling facilities, which indeed means that there is a risk of circumvention if black coils would be excluded from the scope of the product concerned.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e843"><num>(45)</num><p>On the alleged lack of interest of the Union industry to sell black coils, this claim was not substantiated by any evidence. On the contrary, the investigation showed that the Union industry has a significant spare capacity, which is equally available for black and white coils, and that, in spite of the difficult market circumstances, it sold in the investigation period very significant volumes of black coils on the Union market, including (but not exclusively) to Marcegaglia. That shows it has a genuine interest in serving the market.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e849"><num>(46)</num><p>On that basis, it is provisionally concluded that black and white coils share the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and that they form one product group. The claims referred to in recitals (39) to (42) are therefore rejected.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e855"><num>(47)</num><p>Several parties claimed that SSHR of a width of 1600 mm and more, including SSHR of a width of 2000 mm, should be excluded from the scope of the investigation because introducing anti-dumping measures on this special material would further reduce the purchase possibility of a material which is already very hard to procure. It would also limit their competitiveness against non-Union producers of large diameter welded tubes.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e867"><num>(48)</num><p>This claim is rejected. SSHR of a width of 1600 mm or more have the same basic chemical characteristics as smaller SSHR. They also share the same basic physical characteristics except for the width. SSHR of larger width could easily be transformed into smaller SSHR by simple cutting operations. There is therefore a risk of circumvention if larger coils would be excluded from the scope of the product concerned.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e877"><num>(49)</num><p>The Consortium for imports of SST HRF<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="7"><p>This consortium is a group of 20 distributors and users, representing altogether approximately 500000 tonnes of Union consumption and collectively employing ca. 30000 people in the Union.</p></authorialNote> claimed that coils with a thickness above 10 mm should be excluded, as there are only two plants in the Union able to produce SSHR with a thickness above 13 mm. The Commission sees no valid reasons to exclude these coils, which beyond any doubt share the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and uses as all other product types under the product scope.

The Report describes different types of distortions present in the PRC which are cross-cutting and applicable throughout the Chinese economy and affect the prices and/or the raw materials and costs of production of the product under investigation. As explained in Sections b) to i) below, the SSHR industry is subject to a number of governmental interventions described in the Report (coverage by the Five-Years Plans and other documents, raw material distortions, financial distortions etc.), which are explicitly listed and referenced in this regulation. In addition, recitals (104), (121) to (122), (124) to (128), (135), (138), (141), (151), (153) to (154) of this Regulation have also detailed a number of distortions applicable to the SSHR sector and/or to its raw materials and inputs beyond the significant distortions already contained in the Report. The market circumstances and the underlying policies and plans giving rise to significant distortions are still applicable to the SSHR sector and that of its costs of production, despite the Report being released in December 2017. No party submitted any evidence to the contrary. Also the additional sources of significant distortions contained in the Regulation are still applicable and no party has submitted any evidence to the contrary.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e1641"><num>(114)</num><p>Therefore, the Commission provisionally rejected the claims made by the two exporting producers.</p></recital><num>(b)</num><p>Significant distortions affecting the domestic prices and costs in the PRC</p><recital xml:id="rec_d171e1655"><num>(115)</num><p>The Chinese economic system is based on the concept of &apos;<i>socialist market economy</i>&apos;. That concept is enshrined in the Chinese Constitution and determines the economic governance of the PRC. The core principle is the &apos;<i>socialist public ownership of the means of production, namely, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership by the working people</i>&apos;. The State-owned economy is the &apos;<i>leading force of the national economy&apos;</i> and the State has the mandate &apos;<i>to ensure its consolidation and growth</i>&apos;<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="13"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 2, p. 6&#45;7.</p></authorialNote>. Consequently, the overall setup of the Chinese economy not only allows for substantial government interventions into the economy, but such interventions are expressly mandated. The notion of supremacy of public ownership over the private one permeates the entire legal system and is emphasized as a general principle in all central pieces of legislation. The Chinese property law is a prime example: it refers to the primary stage of socialism and entrusts the State with upholding the basic economic system under which the public ownership plays a dominant role. Other forms of ownership are tolerated, with the law permitting them to develop side by side with the State ownership<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="14"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 2, p. 10.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e1689"><num>(116)</num><p>In addition, under Chinese law, the socialist market economy is developed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (&apos;CCP&apos;). The structures of the Chinese State and of the CCP are intertwined at every level (legal, institutional, personal), forming a superstructure in which the roles of CCP and the State are indistinguishable. Following an amendment of the Chinese Constitution in March 2018, the leading role of the CCP was given an even greater prominence by being reaffirmed in the text of Article 1 of the Constitution. Following the already existing first sentence of the provision: &apos;[t]<i>he socialist system is the basic system of the People&apos;s Republic of China</i>&apos; a new second sentence was inserted which reads: &apos;[t]<i>he defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China</i>.&apos;<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="15"><p>Available at http://www.fdi.gov.cn/1800000121_39_4866_0_7.html (last viewed 2 March 2020).</p></authorialNote> This illustrates the unquestioned and ever growing control of the CCP over the economic system of the PRC.

The totality of these plans covers a comprehensive and complex matrix of sectors and crosscutting policies and is present on all levels of government. Plans at provincial level are detailed while national plans set broader targets. Plans also specify the means in order to support the relevant industries/sectors as well as the timeframes in which the objectives need to be achieved. Some plans still contain explicit output targets while this was a regular feature in previous planning cycles. Under the plans, individual industrial sectors and/or projects are being singled out as (positive or negative) priorities in line with the government priorities and specific development goals are attributed to them (industrial upgrade, international expansion etc.). The economic operators, private and State-owned alike, must effectively adjust their business activities according to the realities imposed by the planning system. This is not only because of the binding nature of the plans but also because the relevant Chinese authorities at all levels of government adhere to the system of plans and use their vested powers accordingly, thereby inducing the economic operators to comply with the priorities set out in the plans (see also section e) below)<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="17"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 3, p. 41, 73&#45;74.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e1739"><num>(119)</num><p>Second, on the level of allocation of financial resources, the financial system of the PRC is dominated by the State-owned commercial banks.

The same applies to the other components of the Chinese financial system, such as the stock markets, bond markets, private equity markets etc. Also these parts of the financial sector other than the banking sector are institutionally and operationally set up in a manner not geared towards maximizing the efficient functioning of the financial markets but towards ensuring control and allowing intervention by the State and the CCP<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="19"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 6, p. 122&#45;135.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e1755"><num>(120)</num><p>Third, on the level of regulatory environment, the interventions by the State into the economy take a number of forms. For instance, the public procurement rules are regularly used in pursuit of policy goals other than economic efficiency, thereby undermining market based principles in the area. The applicable legislation specifically provides that public procurement shall be conducted in order to facilitate the achievement of goals designed by State policies. However, the nature of these goals remains undefined, thereby leaving broad margin of appreciation to the decision-making bodies<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="20"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 7, p. 167&#45;168.</p></authorialNote>. Similarly, in the area of investment, the GOC maintains significant control and influence over the destination and magnitude of both State and private investment.

Moreover, the role of the State in the insolvency proceedings remains strong and active, often having direct influence on the outcome of the proceedings<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="51"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 6, p. 138&#45;149.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e2174"><num>(140)</num><p>In addition, the shortcomings of the system of property rights are particularly obvious in relation to ownership of land and land-use rights in the PRC<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="52"><p>Report &#45; Chapter 9, p. 216.</p></authorialNote>.

The Commission decided to exclude imports from the PRC into the representative country as it concluded in recital (156) that it is not appropriate to use domestic prices and costs in the PRC due to the existence of significant distortions in accordance with Article 2(6a)(b) of the basic Regulation. Given that there is no evidence showing that the same distortions do not equally affect products intended for export, the Commission considered that the same distortions affected export prices. Furthermore, it appears that the import price of the main raw materials exported by the PRC into Brazil are lower than the weighted average of the imports of other countries.

The export sales of the industry could thus only for a very small part compensate the negative developments both in terms of volumes and prices on the Union market.

The Union industry was initially also able to pass on this cost increase in its sales prices, however that resulted in an important loss of market share and profitability.

Contrary to these claims, the investigation did not reveal any decrease in consumption on the Union market but rather a sharp loss of market share by the Union industry due to a strong increase in imports (see section 4.4.2 and tables 5 and 8).

The Union industry claimed that 2017 was a suitable year for establishing a target profit. The Commission considers that 2017 was an exceptionally good year for the industry and that the profit achieved by the sampled Union producers in that year (10,2 %) is thus likely to be tainted if used as a target profit. Moreover, the market share of imports in 2017 was already 29,1 %. By contrast, in 2016 the market share of imports was considerably lower than in 2017 (21,5 %).

This would result in an improvement of the Union industry&apos;s profitability towards levels considered necessary for this capital intensive industry. The Union industry has suffered material injury caused by imports at dumped prices from the countries concerned. It is recalled that a number of key injury indicators showed a negative trend during the period considered. In particular, market share and sales volume, as well as indicators pertaining to the financial performance of the sampled Union producers, such as profitability and return on investment, were seriously affected. It is therefore important to restore prices to non-dumped or at least non-injurious level in order to allow all producers to operate on the Union market under fair trading conditions. In the absence of measures, a further deterioration of the Union industry&apos;s economic situation is very likely. A bad performance on the SSHR segment would impact the downstream segments of Union producers, and in particular their captive production. Union producers heavily rely on the business model of a combination of free market sales and captive production. A deterioration of the free market segment could likewise put at risk the captive production segment, which represents bigger production volumes and employment figures than the former.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7384"><num>(364)</num><p>It is therefore provisionally concluded that the imposition of anti-dumping duties would be in the interest of the Union industry as it would allow it to recover from the effects of injurious dumping found.</p></recital><num>7.2.</num><p>Interest of unrelated importers</p><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7399"><num>(365)</num><p>Two parties made themselves known as unrelated importers and replied to the relevant questionnaire.

Therefore, there was no cooperation from genuine importers. According to the cooperating service center operator, increasing the price of the products concerned results in higher cost of manufacturing for European users of the products, causing injury to these users. More specifically, the party made a product exclusion request which is addressed under Section 2.3 along with other such claims.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7412"><num>(367)</num><p>On that basis, at this stage there is no indication that measures would be against the interest of importers.</p></recital><num>7.3.</num><p>Interest of users</p><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7427"><num>(368)</num><p>Two users cooperated with the investigation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7433"><num>(369)</num><p>One of the users which submitted a questionnaire reply was a producer of stainless steel tubes. With regard to that user, the Commission found that in view of its purchasing and importing volumes, its total profit and its profit derived from output products that involve the product concerned as an input, the imposition of measures would not unduly harm it.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7439"><num>(370)</num><p>The second cooperating user is a producer of stainless steel products which competes with the Union industry on several of its key downstream markets. It purchases significant volumes of SSHR from the Union industry as well as from producers outside the Union, including in the countries concerned. That user has raised concerns on the security of supply and purchase prices following any imposition of duties. It is the only large independent user of the product concerned in the Union. Without integrated steel production, it fully depends on coils supplies from other parties to manufacture its downstream products. The party claimed that the Union industry is not interested in selling additional large volumes of SSHR to it, and in particular one product type (black coils), at competitive prices, since the Union producers would prefer to keep them for their own captive use. This claim is rebutted by the fact that the Union industry had spare capacities throughout the period considered that exceeded the total demand of that user at least fourfold. Moreover, as the complainant has submitted, several Union producers are ready to supply black coils as communicated on the producers&apos; websites. Finally, given the user&apos;s already established supply chains and contacts with third country producers, it is also reasonable to expect that it will be able also to diversify its supply by purchasing more from third countries.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7445"><num>(371)</num><p>Provided that all relevant factors (in particular sources, volumes and prices before duties of purchases and turnover achieved on downstream products) would remain unchanged as compared to the investigation period, the Commission established that the overall annual profit of that user would be seriously affected in a negative way if duties were imposed on imports from the PRC and Indonesia pursuant to Article 7(2a) of the basic Regulation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7451"><num>(372)</num><p>If, under the same assumption as in recital (369), duties were imposed on imports from the PRC and Indonesia pursuant to Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, the overall annual profit would also be affected but to a much lesser extent.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7457"><num>(373)</num><p>The above scenarios are based on static assumptions (i.e. all relevant factors remain unchanged except that duties will be imposed and hence to be factored in).

If prices of imports from in particular the PRC and Indonesia will be made subject to an upwards correction, imports from other sources of supply are likely to resume in larger volumes. In particular, we note that imports from South Korea were at high levels up to and including 2016, when they amounted to 65000 tonnes. In view of market developments since then, these imports have lost important market shares over the years (see table 15) but it can be expected that after the imposition of measures exporting producers from Korea but also from other producing countries like South Africa will again increasingly focus on the Union market as they will be in a better position to compete, to the benefit of the users. Also, it is expected that due to the relief offered by the measures the Union industry will be in a position to sell more volumes to the users at competitive prices. The Union industry simply cannot afford to lose important market shares in the Union as this investigation testified. As regards the second user mentioned above, owing to its size and importance as a customer of the Union industry, it may have some leverage that is likely to increase in case it buys even larger volumes from the Union industry.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7473"><num>(375)</num><p>It is also to be noted that it is foreseen that in July 2021, the currently applicable steel safeguard measures which also concern the product conerned will expire.

Indeed, if the level of duties were to be set pursuant to Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, all of the cooperating users are expected to remain profitable.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7489"><num>(377)</num><p>However, if duties were to be imposed pursuant to Article 7(2a) of the basic Regulation, the Commission established that the possible impact of measures against the PRC and Indonesia at the level of the dumping margin would be disproportionate in view of the possible strong negative effects on supply chains for certain Union companies and in particular on users. Indeed, the Commission found that in such a scenario the user industry, and in particular users which purchased significant volumes from the PRC and/or Indonesia in the investigation period, might be unduly affected and could become as a result loss making.</p></recital><num>7.4.</num><p>Conclusion on Union interest</p><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7504"><num>(378)</num><p>On the basis of the above, and under the condition that duties are to be imposed pursuant to Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission provisionally concluded that there were no compelling reasons that it was not in the Union interest to impose measures on imports of certain hot rolled stainless steel sheets and coils originating in the countries concerned at this stage of the investigation.</p></recital><num>8.</num><p>PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES</p><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7519"><num>(379)</num><p>On the basis of the conclusions reached by the Commission on dumping, injury, causation and Union interest, provisional measures should be imposed imports of flat-rolled products of stainless steel, whether or not in coils (including products cut-to-length and narrow strip), not further worked than hot-rolled originating in Indonesia, the People&apos;s Republic of China and Taiwan, to prevent further injury being caused to the Union industry by the dumped imports.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7525"><num>(380)</num><p>Provisional anti-dumping measures should be imposed in accordance with the lesser duty rule in Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation.

Indeed, even if presented with an invoice meeting all the requirements set out in Article 1(3) of this Regulation, the customs authorities of Member States should carry out their usual checks and may, like in all other cases, require additional documents (shipping documents, etc.) for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of the particulars contained in the declaration and ensure that the subsequent application of the rate of duty is justified, in compliance with customs law.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d171e7712"><num>(386)</num><p>Should the exports by one of the companies benefiting from lower individual duty rates increase significantly in volume, in particular after the imposition of the measures concerned, such an increase in volume could be considered as constituting in itself a change in the pattern of trade due to the imposition of measures within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In such circumstances, an anti-circumvention investigation may be initiated, provided the conditions for so doing are met.
