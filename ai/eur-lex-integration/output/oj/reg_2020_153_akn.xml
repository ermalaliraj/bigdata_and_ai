The Annex to that Implementing Decision demarcates and lists certain areas of the Member States concerned in Parts I to IV thereof, differentiated by the level of risk based on the epidemiological situation as regards that disease. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU has been amended several times to take account of changes in the epidemiological situation in the Union as regards African swine fever that need to be reflected in that Annex.

This outbreak of African swine fever in domestic pigs constitutes an increased level of risk, which should be reflected in that Annex. Accordingly, this new area of Poland, affected by this recent outbreak of African swine fever, should now be listed in Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU. Given that Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU lists the areas where the epidemiological situation is still evolving and very dynamic, when any amendments are made to the areas listed in that Part, particular consideration must always be given to the effect on the surrounding areas, as has been done in this instance. It is also necessary to list new areas in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU, that are in proximity to the new area listed in Part III thereof.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d174e139"><num>(4)</num><p>Following this recent occurrence of African swine fever in domestic pigs in Poland, and taking into account the current epidemiological situation in the Union, regionalisation in this Member State has been reassessed and updated.
