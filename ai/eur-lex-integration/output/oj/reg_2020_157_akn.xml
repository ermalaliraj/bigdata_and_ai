Main differences between the two powders are particle sizes and the content of some macronutrients. The powder with high protein content has a particle size below 130 μm and protein content of at least 40 %, while the powder with high fibre content has a particle size below 400 μm and dietary fibre content of at least 50 %.

The Authority considered that this study is also applicable to the assessment of the chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders, since they only differ from chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) already included in the Union list as regards defatting, a treatment which is neutral with regard to the formation of acrylamide.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d189e251"><num>(11)</num><p>The Authority noted that the food &apos;pasta&apos; may be subject to heat treatment to temperatures above 120 °C and potentially could represent a relevant source of acrylamide, while other proposed food categories do not present safety concerns in relation to possible formation of acrylamide.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d189e261"><num>(12)</num><p>In the opinion on safety of chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i> L.) powders, the Authority considered that additional information is needed from the applicant and/or from the public domain, to address the potential for acrylamide formation when foods containing chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders undergo heat treatment at or above 120 °C. In accordance with Article 11(4) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 the Authority has requested additional information from the applicant relating to potential formation of process contaminants which may be formed during processing and production of a food (at the level of the manufacturer) and/or when a food with added chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders is subjected to cooking (heat treatment at consumer level). The period set for the provision of the additional information was set for the 13 May 2019. Although the applicant provided additional information by the set deadline, the Authority concluded that the information provided is not sufficient to address potential formation of acrylamide in pasta at temperatures above 120 °C which could potentially represent a relevant source of acrylamide at consumer level.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d189e279"><num>(13)</num><p>In the absence of information on the potential formation of acrylamide in &apos;pasta&apos;, if subject to such heat treatment, the Authority deferred the evaluation of chia seeds powder in pasta to when the additional information becomes available. It follows, that the Commission, at this stage, does not dispose of the opinion of the Authority necessary pursuant to Article 12(1)(a) and (c) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 for the approval of the use of chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders in pasta that may be subject to heat-treatment at or above 120 °C. Therefore, a further decision about such use will be taken after the publication of the relevant opinion of the Authority.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d189e293"><num>(14)</num><p>The opinion of the Authority also identified two case reports from the available scientific literature, which linked the consumption of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) to allergic reactions and concluded on this basis that allergic reactions upon consumption of chia seeds may occur. Furthermore, the Authority considers that the allergenic potential of chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders is similar to that of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) because the manufacturing steps employed in the production of the powders are not expected to modify the allergenic potential of the chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>). Considering that, to date, only those two allergy cases have been reported and, in light of the widespread consumption of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) and their presence on the Union and global market for many years, no specific labelling requirements concerning potential allergic reactions upon consumption of chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders should be included in the Union list of authorised novel foods, until further scientific evidence on the allergenic potential of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) is obtained and assessed by the Authority.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d189e321"><num>(15)</num><p>The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,</p></recital></recitals><formula name="enactingFormula"><p>HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:</p></formula></preamble><body><article xml:id="art_d189e330"><num>Article 1</num><heading/><paragraph><num>1.</num><content><p>Partially defatted chia seed (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) powders as specified in the Annex to this Regulation shall be included in the Union list of authorised novel foods established in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470.</p></content></paragraph><paragraph><num>2.</num><content><p>The entry in the Union list referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the conditions of use and labelling requirements laid down in the Annex.</p></content></paragraph></article><article xml:id="art_d189e346"><num>Article 2</num><heading/><paragraph><content><p>The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.</p></content></paragraph></article><article xml:id="art_d189e351"><num>Article 3</num><heading/><paragraph><content><p>This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in <i>the Official Journal of the European Union</i>.</p></content></paragraph></article><clause><content><p>This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.</p></content></clause></body><conclusions><p>Done at Brussels, 6 April 2020.</p><block name="signatory"><signature><organization refersTo="">For the Commission</organization><role refersTo="">The President</role><person refersTo="">Ursula VON DER LEYEN</person></signature></block></conclusions></bill></akomaNtoso>
