In particular, metabolites M30, M34 and M46 are predicted to occur above the parametric drinking water limit of 0,1 Î¼g/L in all pertinent scenarios for all proposed uses of thiacloprid. These metabolites are considered <i>a priori</i> of concern since it cannot be excluded that they share the same carcinogenic properties of the parent active substance thiacloprid, which is classified in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="7"><p>Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p. 1).</p></authorialNote> as carcinogenic category 2. Therefore, it cannot currently be established that the presence of metabolites of thiacloprid in groundwater will not result in unacceptable effects on groundwater and in harmful effects on human health.

The Authority presented the outcome of the assessment of that information in its conclusion. Nevertheless, given the concerns identified in recital 9, a conclusion on whether exposure to humans is negligible for the purposes of point 3.6.4 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, is not necessary for the decision on whether the approval of thiacloprid can be renewed.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d16e206"><num>(11)</num><p>Furthermore, given the concerns identified, it is also not possible to provide for an approval in accordance with Article 4(7) to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d16e212"><num>(12)</num><p>The Commission invited the applicant to submit its comments on the conclusion of the Authority.
