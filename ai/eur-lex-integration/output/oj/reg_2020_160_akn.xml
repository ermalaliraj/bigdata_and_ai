These parties asked the Commission to confirm that this code only refers to wheels for road use, and therefore it did not cover wheels for wheelbarrows and hand trucks.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e359"><num>(16)</num><p>The Commission confirmed that this interpretation was correct and that wheels for wheelbarrows and hand trucks do not fall within the scope of this investigation. To ensure clarity, the Commission adjusted the description of the TARIC code in question accordingly. On 29 October 2019, the Commission also published a note to the file informing all interested parties about this adjustment.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e368"><num>(17)</num><p>Right before the publication of the provisional Regulation an unrelated importer requested the exclusion of spare road steel wheels for passenger cars on the grounds that they do not have the same basic technical and physical characteristics as all other products falling within the product scope. This importer argued that spare road steel wheels cannot be used as normal wheels because their speed is limited to 80 km/hour. The party further claimed that the overall production of spare road steel wheels for passenger cars is very small in the Union and even non-existent in the case of the replacement market (as opposed to the Original Equipment Manufacturer or &apos;OEM&apos; segment where wheels are incorporated to the car during the manufacturing process).</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e378"><num>(18)</num><p>The Commission dismissed the unrelated importer&apos;s request. The speed limit does not alter the basic technical and physical characteristics of a wheel and the importer did not bring any other evidence showing that such spare road wheels would have technical and physical characteristics different from all other products falling within the product scope of the investigation. Furthermore, the party itself confirmed that there is production of these types of wheels in the Union and therefore competition with imported spare road steel wheels. The fact that these wheels are allegedly not produced and sold by the Union industry in one of the two main distribution channels is irrelevant since the steel road wheels in the replacement market and those sold on the OEM segment have the same basic technical and physical characteristics.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e384"><num>(19)</num><p>Following the publication of the provisional Regulation, a party criticised the fact that the complaint uses the application of a wheel, i.e. wheels used on the road, to determine whether a steel wheel falls within the scope of the investigation or not. Instead, the party proposed speed and load as the distinguishing factor to determine whether a steel wheel is designed to be used on the road and therefore falls within the scope of the investigation. In particular, the party considered that only wheels designed to travel above 50 km/h are designed and built as road wheels. The party reiterated the claim following final disclosure.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e390"><num>(20)</num><p>The Commission considered that this claim did not question the product definition or the scope of the investigation itself, but rather suggests an alternative way to describe steel road wheels. The Commission does however not consider that speed is a relevant factor for defining the product scope, as explained above in recital (18), and therefore dismissed the party&apos;s proposal.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e396"><num>(21)</num><p>One exporting producer complained that the provisional regulation contained neither technical definitions for the products excluded nor procedures for confirming with Union customs officials and the Commission services whether or not certain products were excluded from the scope of measures.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e402"><num>(22)</num><p>The Commission confirmed, however, that the technical definitions of the products excluded and customs procedures already in place were sufficient for the proper application and monitoring of the current anti-dumping measures, and that, at this stage, additional definitions or procedures did not appear to be necessary in this case. This claim was therefore rejected.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e408"><num>(23)</num><p>Following the publication of the provisional Regulation, an unrelated importer submitted that steel wheels for agricultural trailers or semi-trailers with a rim diameter of 16 inches and more (up to 54 inches) should be excluded from the scope of the investigation because they have different physical and technical characteristics than steel wheels for truck trailers or semi-trailers and in term of speed, load capacity and stud holes. It is noted that the provisional Regulation mentioned the exclusion from the scope of the measures wheels for agricultural trailers and other trailed agricultural equipment used in fields with a rim diameter of not more than 16 inches for clarification purposes. However, while this exclusion narrowed the scope of the investigation, it did not change the fact that wheels mainly designed and used for off the road purposes were never covered by the product definition, as explained in recital (24).</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e416"><num>(24)</num><p>It is noted that the provisional Regulation provisionally excluded from the scope of the measures wheels for passenger car trailers, caravans, agricultural trailers and other trailed agricultural equipment used in fields, with a rim diameter of not more than 16 inches. Some parties considered that, as a consequence, wheels of agricultural trailers and other trailed agricultural equipment used in fields, with a rim diameter of more than 16 inches would be covered by the scope of the measures. However, the Commission clarified that, by this exclusion, it did not intend to include in the scope of the investigation certain other off the road wheels. Indeed, wheels designed for uses other than on public roads were specifically excluded from the product definition in the Notice of Initiation. This was also the intention of the complainant. Indeed, the open version of the complaint specified that OTR (Off The Road) wheels, i.e. wheels for equipment not normally designed for the road, such as agricultural wheels, wheels for earthmoving and mining equipment and wheels for industrial handling (such as fork lift truck wheels or cranes) are excluded from this complaint. The investigation did not bring to light any reasons to question this exclusion, and thus steel wheels for agricultural trailers or semi-trailers were not included in the scope of the investigation, irrespective of their rim diameters.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e422"><num>(25)</num><p>Following final disclosure, EUWA proposed to add &apos;wheels for use in construction vehicles&apos; in the list of products excluded. The Commission deemed this addition unnecessary given that those wheels were never covered by the product definition. EUWA&apos;s proposal was thus rejected.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e432"><num>(26)</num><p>Following the publication of the provisional Regulation, an unrelated importer submitted that certain wheels for passenger cars for winter tyres should be excluded from the scope of the investigation, namely wheels specially designed for fitting multiple car models. The company claimed that Union producers refused to produce this type of wheels and that such wheels have resource-saving characteristics and serve a minor share of the &apos;aftermarket&apos; or replacement market. The party reiterated the claims following final disclosure.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e442"><num>(27)</num><p>The investigation found that steel wheels for winter tyres &#45; including those fitting multiple car models &#45; have the same basic physical and technical characteristics as other products falling within the product scope of the investigation. The wheel from the unrelated importer is a &apos;universal&apos; passenger car wheel that has a centre hole adapter ring. This latter feature allows using one base wheel for different centre hole diameters by means of different centre hole adapters. The result is the same as a fix centre hole. The product competes with wheels for winter tyres produced by the Union producers and which are distributed both on the OEM and the aftermarket channel. Thus there was no basis for this product type to be excluded from the scope of the investigation. The Commission therefore rejected the unrelated importer&apos;s request.</p></recital><num>2.2.</num><p>Conclusion</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e461"><num>(28)</num><p>Having taken into account all comments submitted by interested parties after the provisional Regulation, the Commission confirmed that the product definition in recital (42) of the provisional Regulation properly reflected the scope of the investigation.

The Commission was not able to reconcile the exporting producer&apos;s audited accounts and tax reports with its reported export sales. Therefore, the Commission found that the information provided was unreliable, triggering the need for the application of Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation to complete the Commission&apos;s determination of the exporting producer&apos;s dumping and injury margin.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e565"><num>(30)</num><p>In its submission after the provisional disclosure, the company in question reiterated its arguments against the application of Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation, already presented in the reply to the letter sent to the company on 19 June 2019 on the possible use of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and during the hearings in the provisional stage of the investigation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e574"><num>(31)</num><p>Furthermore, the company requested the Commission to resort to Article 18(3) of the basic Regulation rather than Article 18(1) in order to make an individual dumping and injury margin calculation. It based its request on the allegation that the company cooperated to the best of its ability and thus claimed that the information it submitted should not be totally rejected. The company also submitted alternative methodologies to calculate the export price, arguing that those alternatives would allow the Commission to determine an individual dumping and injury margin for the company.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e580"><num>(32)</num><p>More specifically, the company proposed:<list><point><num>(a)</num>several alternative methods which would allow verification of its reported export transactions against outside sources, such as using data from the Union&apos;s customs authorities or records of their clients in the Union;</point><point><num>(b)</num>to use as a basis for the export price in the calculation the prices on the domestic VAT invoices issued to an unrelated broker.</point></list></p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e600"><num>(33)</num><p>Additionally, three of the six unrelated Union importers purchasing the product concerned from the company supported in their submissions the proposal to use their import data and to calculate on that basis an individual dumping margin for the Chinese exporting producer in question.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e606"><num>(34)</num><p>In reply to those submissions, the Commission underlined that no new facts were brought to its attention which would change the basic finding, on the basis of the evidence collected during the on-spot verification at the exporting producer&apos;s premises, that the sales transactions to the Union reported by that producer could not be reconciled with its audited accounts and tax reports.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e612"><num>(35)</num><p>The Commission also considered that the provisions of Article 18(3) of the basic Regulation could not assist the exporting producer in the present case since the question before it was not whether the information submitted by the party was not ideal in all respect, but rather that there was fundamental uncertainty over the reliability of the records and information provided to the Commission. There was no way for the Commission to independently verify that data. Accordingly, the Commission was not in possession of the necessary evidence that would allow it to complete its calculations as regards the exporting producer&apos;s dumping and injury margins. Furthermore, and in any event, none of the proposed alternatives would result in the possibility to reconcile the reported sales and cost figures with the official documents verified at the premises of the company in question (audited accounts and tax reports). Moreover, none of the suggested alternatives would ensure that the Commission was provided with the full list of export transactions from the exporting producer concerned during the investigation period. Thus, the Commission could not guarantee that a reasonably accurate finding of dumping or injury margin could be made, absent a complete and verifiable set of export transactions during the investigation period.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e620"><num>(36)</num><p>The information supplied by the company was consequently considered unreliable and accordingly disregarded pursuant to Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5"><p>Case T-413/13, City Cycle Industries, ECLI:EU:T:2015:164, paras. 120-121.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e630"><num>(37)</num><p>Following the final disclosure, the company reiterated its claim that its export price, necessary for the determination of the dumping and injury margins, could have been established based on the alternative methodologies explained in recitals (31) to (33).

The company was not able to provide evidence that the data was complete and, in any event, as explained before, the Commission could not verify it either. Therefore, the claim that the Commission never requested additional information is inapposite.

In the present case, the main problem faced by the Commission was the fundamental unreliability of the company&apos;s records, which, being a problem at the root, could not be solved by applying adjustments to the information submitted by the company. Since the company records could not be verified, the Commission could not ascertain either with the necessary degree of certainty that the data set of export transactions (including products exported, volumes and values)were accurate and complete. In this respect, the Commission also observed that the data set of export prices provided and confirmed by other means, such as data from importers or export statistics, could not be reconciled with the audited accounts of the company, further suggesting that the data could not be relied upon.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e672"><num>(41)</num><p>In addition, the company claimed that the Commission erred in law when it applied the provisions of Article 18 of the basic Regulation to the determination of the normal value as only information concerning the export price were found not reliable.

The company submitted information for the determination of its individual dumping margin. The Commission found that the information for the determination of the export price, which is a fundamental element in the determination of the dumping margin, was not reliable since it could not be verified. The deficiencies were of such nature that none of the information provided for the determination of the export price could be used. In such case, any determination of the normal value would be redundant as no dumping margin could be established in the absence of the export price.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e693"><num>(43)</num><p>Finally, the company claimed that the Commission violated the company&apos;s rights of defence by not disclosing the determination of the normal value.

Therefore, and absent this information, the Commission considered it appropriate that the margin given to the company be equal to the residual margin.

According to this interested party, dumping would be significant on the wheels for commercial vehicles whereas that would not be the case for wheels for passenger cars. Following final disclosure the same importer insisted that wheels for passenger cars and wheels for commercial vehicles should not be considered together in a single investigation on the grounds that wheels for passenger cars represent less than 1 % of total Union consumption in kilos.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e826"><num>(55)</num><p>The Commission however considered that wheels for passenger cars and those for commercial vehicles have the same basic physical and technical characteristics and are just different types of the product concerned. Thus, the present investigation covered one product only. The potential differences in the magnitude of dumping between different types of the product concerned was in no way relevant for the assessment of the scope of an investigation, that is, the definition of the product concerned. In any event, the Commission found substantial dumping for all types of products investigated. Accordingly, even if that element were a relevant fact to be considered, <i>quod non</i>, the claim was factually incorrect. It is recalled that the findings made in recitals (190) to (192) of the provisional Regulation show that both China and the Union producers are similarly active in the passenger car wheels and in the commercial wheels, both representing a significant share of the exports from the country concerned into the Union and of the Union industry sales. In the Union, around 65 % of the sales in pieces are for passenger car wheels. Dumped imports, regardless of the product type or distribution channels, are capable of negatively affecting the Union industry. Therefore, the claim was rejected.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e835"><num>(56)</num><p>In the absence of other comments with respect to the Union market and consumption, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (190) to (195) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>4.3.</num><p>Imports from the country concerned</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e850"><num>(57)</num><p>In the absence of comments with respect to this section, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (196) to (204) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>4.4.</num><p>Economic situation of the Union industry</p><num>4.4.1.</num><p>General remarks</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e874"><num>(58)</num><p>In the absence of any comments, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (205) to (209) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>4.4.2.</num><p>Macroeconomic indicators</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e889"><num>(59)</num><p>In the absence of comments with respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (210) to (218) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>4.4.3.</num><p>Microeconomic indicators</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e904"><num>(60)</num><p>In the absence of comments with respect to the microeconomic indicators, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (219) to (230) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>4.4.4.</num><p>Conclusion on injury</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e920"><num>(61)</num><p>In the absence of comments with respect to the conclusion on injury, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (231) to (234) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>5.</num><p>CAUSATION</p><num>5.1.</num><p>Effects of the dumped imports</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e944"><num>(62)</num><p>At provisional stage, the Commission concluded that the Union industry lost sales volume and market share due to dumped imports from the country concerned, and that these imports undercut the sales prices of the Union producers. There was also evidence at provisional stage that those dumped prices caused price suppression during the investigation period. The latter findings are reflected in Table 8 of the provisional Regulation, which shows that already in 2017 the prices of Union industry sales in the Union increased less than its costs of production, whereas in the investigation period the Union producers were forced to sell below their costs of production. Those findings were confirmed at definitive stage.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e950"><num>(63)</num><p>After final disclosure and during a hearing with the Hearing Officer, a Chinese group submitted that the decline in the market share of the Union industry shall not be completely attributed to Chinese imports because the increase of the Chinese market share over the period considered was lower than the decrease of the Union producers&apos; market share in that period<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="9"><p>Table 3 of the provisional Regulation shows that the market share of Chinese imports in the Union market went up from 2,6 % in 2015 to 5,3 % in the investigation period. Table 6 of the provisional Regulation shows that Union producers&apos; market share in the Union market went down from 84,9 % in 2015 to 79,8 % in the investigation period.</p></authorialNote>. The same group said that the Commission had not elaborated how, even if Chinese import prices decreased by 7 % over the period considered, the low market share held by Chinese imports had negatively impacted the Union market, which was dominated by Union producers.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e960"><num>(64)</num><p>The Commission notes it is not required to attribute all the injury found to the subject imports; rather the attribution analysis examines whether the subject imports are a cause for the injury found, which in this case it is not contested by any interested party. As explained in recitals (239) to (252) of the provisional Regulation, the price pressure from dumped imports from the PRC undermined the Union industry&apos;s sales volumes and sales prices throughout the period considered but was particularly damaging in 2017 and the investigation period when costs were increasing. Such pressure caused severe production, sales and profitability losses in the investigation period. None of the other factors examined, either individually or collectively, attenuate the causal link between the dumped imports and the injury suffered by the Union industry.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e966"><num>(65)</num><p>In the absence of other comments with respect to attribution of the injury found to the subject imports, the Commission confirmed its conclusions set out in recitals (236) to (238) of the provisional Regulation.</p></recital><num>5.2.</num><p>Effects of other factors</p><recital xml:id="rec_d192e981"><num>(66)</num><p>Following the publication of the provisional Regulation, an unrelated importer questioned the reason why the investigation had not been opened against Turkey.

In fact, the complaint contained evidence that import prices from Turkey were at a level high enough not to cause injury to the Union industry. Secondly, the Commission analysed, as explained in recital (241) of the provisional Regulation, the development of both Chinese and Turkish import volumes and prices over the period considered. Based on the evidence on the case file, the Commission concluded that Turkish prices were on average around 25 % higher than Chinese prices.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e994"><num>(68)</num><p>Following final disclosure a Chinese group noted the Turkish import volumes were higher than Chinese import volumes. It added that, unlike import prices from China, Turkish import prices declined between 2017 and the investigation period and claimed that the Commission had failed to analyse the impact of such trend on the injury suffered by Union producers. The party reiterated these issues during a hearing with the Hearing Officer, where it also claimed that during the investigation period the market share of Turkish imports (9,6 %) was significant as compared to the one of Chinese imports (5,3 %) and noted the market share of other imports (5,2 %).</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d192e1000"><num>(69)</num><p>The Commission reiterated that the Eurostat data did not allow for a precise picture concerning the price level of imports, but it also noted that Tables 4 and 12 of the provisional Regulation showed that in every year of the period considered and during the investigation period average Chinese import prices per kilo were below Turkish import prices and far below import prices from other countries. The difference in the evolution of Chinese import prices and the Turkish import prices is minor and deemed irrelevant, also bearing in mind the shortcomings of Eurostat data highlighted in recital (200) of the provisional Regulation and the uncontested findings summarized in recital (241) of the provisional Regulation as mentioned in recital (67) above.
