Therefore, that scientific opinion gives sufficient grounds to establish that the above-mentioned uses of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) comply with the requirements of Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283. It is therefore appropriate that the conditions of use of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) as listed in the Union list of authorised novel foods are amended by including all of the above food categories and to remove the setting of maximum levels and the corresponding specific labelling requirement relating to the maximum daily intake. In addition, although the use of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) in puddings was not explicitly included in the assessment of the Authority, the opinion gives sufficient grounds to also authorise the extension of use of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) to puddings that do not require heat treatment at or above 120 °C in their manufacture, processing or preparation. Puddings are to be understood as a subcategory of products commonly known as desserts, which are usually flavoured and sweet in taste.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d18e472"><num>(24)</num><p>In the same opinion, the Authority considered one study, retrieved by the Authority itself from the publicly available scientific literature, and which was not part of the evidence submitted by applicants in support of the proposed extensions of use of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>), which pointed to the possible formation of acrylamide when chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) are used in foods which require heat treatment at or above 120 °C in their manufacture, processing or preparation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d18e484"><num>(25)</num><p>In that opinion, the Authority considered that additional information is needed from applicants and/or from the public domain, to address the potential for acrylamide formation when foods containing chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) undergo heat treatment at or above 120 °C. In accordance with Article 11(4) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 the Authority has requested additional information from the relevant applicant relating to potential formation of process contaminants which may be formed during processing and production of a food (at the level of the manufacturer) and/or when a food with added chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) is subjected to cooking (heat treatment at consumer level). The period set established for the provision of the additional information ends in March 2020. In the absence of such information in the submitted applications, the Authority deferred the evaluation of those extensions of use of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) in foods which require heat treatment at or above 120 °C in their manufacture, processing or preparation (bakery wares, cereal and cereal products, herbs, spices, seasonings, soups and broths, sauces, salads and savoury based sandwich spreads and protein products, total diet replacement foods for weight control as defined in Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="12"><p>Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control and repealing Council Directive 92/52/EEC, Commission Directives 96/8/EC, 1999/21/EC, 2006/125/EC and 2006/141/EC, Directive 2009/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 41/2009 and (EC) No 953/2009 (OJ L 181, 29.6.2013, p. 35).</p></authorialNote>, foods bearing statements on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in accordance with the requirements of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 828/2014<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="13"><p>Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 828/2014 of 30 July 2014 on the requirements for the provision of information to consumers on the absence or reduced presence of gluten in food (OJ L 228, 31.7.2014, p. 5).</p></authorialNote>, ready to eat savouries and snacks and desserts) to when the additional information becomes available. It follows, that the Commission, at this stage, does not dispose of the opinion of the Authority necessary pursuant to Article 12(1)(a) and (c) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 for the approval of the extension of uses involving the treatment of chia seeds (<i>Salvia hispanica</i>) at or above 120 °C.
