Due to the rapid increase in the number of cases, on 11 March 2020 the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic. On 12 March 2020, in view of the rapid escalation in the WHO European Region, with more than 20000 confirmed cases and almost 1000 deaths, the WHO Regional Director for Europe indicated that Europe had become the epicentre of this pandemic.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d221e78"><num>(2)</num><p>As a consequence, Member States have taken a number of extraordinary preventive and containment measures such as quarantine, closures of non-essential shops, schools and universities, implementation of remote working policies as well as movement and travel restrictions or bans. Those measures make it impossible or very difficult for certain Council members to travel with a view to being physically present at Council meetings held at the Council&apos;s seat.

During the period of application of this Decision, and only during this period, a decision to use the ordinary written procedure that is taken by the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States (Coreper) should be taken in accordance with the voting rule applicable for the adoption of the Council act concerned.
