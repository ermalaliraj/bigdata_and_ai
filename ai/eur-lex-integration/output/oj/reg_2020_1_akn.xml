The applicant requested the additive to be classified in the additive category &apos;sensory additive&apos; and in the functional group &apos;colourants&apos;.

It also concluded that the inhalation exposure to additive is regarded as hazardous for the user of the additive and that no conclusion could be drawn on the irritancy potential to skin or eyes and on the skin sensitation. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive. In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 429/2008<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4"><p>Commission Regulation (EC) No 429/2008 of 25 April 2008 on detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the preparation and the presentation of applications and the assessment and the authorisation of feed additives (OJ L 133, 22.5.2008, p. 1).</p></authorialNote>, phase I of the environmental risk assessment has determined that ponceau 4R, as an additive intended for non-food producing animals, is exempted from further assessment due to the unlikelihood of a significant environmental effect, there being no scientifically-based evidence for concern having been identified by the Authority in its above-mentioned opinion. The Authority also stated that for this additive, which is also authorised in food, where the function is the same as that for feed, no further demonstration of efficacy might be necessary. However, the Authority, considering the wide variety of feedingstuffs, requested further demonstration. The applicant demonstrated the efficacy in a typical feed matrix for 50 mg/kg but also indicated that for other matrixes (colour in petfood may range from almost white to dark brown) lower levels may be used specially in pale matrixes (the applicant provided in the dossier some evidence for lower levels). As the recommended maximum level proposed by the Authority for this additive is similar to the levels authorised for food in different types of products, the Commission considered that there is sufficient evidence of the efficacy of this substance. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d2e156"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of ponceau 4R shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
