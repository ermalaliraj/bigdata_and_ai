It also concluded that exposure to users by inhalation is unlikely and that no conclusion could be drawn on skin or eyes sensitisation. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive. The Authority concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious in improving zootechnical performance. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d234e108"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of the preparation of oregano oil, caraway oil, carvacrol, methyl salicylate and L-menthol shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
