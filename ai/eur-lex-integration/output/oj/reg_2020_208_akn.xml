Greece received financial support from its European partners on concessional terms and specific measures to place debt on a more sustainable footing were adopted in 2012 and again by the European Stability Mechanism in 2017. On 22 June 2018, it was politically agreed in the Eurogroup to implement additional measures to ensure debt sustainability. These include the extension of weighted average maturities by an additional 10 years, the deferral of interest and amortisation by an additional 10 years as well as the implementation of other debt measures. Two additional measures (the abolition of the step-up interest rate margin related to the debt buy-back tranche of the European Financial Stability Facility programme as of 2018 and the restoration of the transfer of equivalent amounts to the income earned by euro-area national central banks on Greek government bonds held under the Agreement on Net Financial Assets and the Securities Market Programme) can be agreed bi-annually in the Eurogroup on the basis of positive reporting under enhanced surveillance on Greece&apos;s compliance with its post-programme policy commitments. In this regard, the release of the first and second tranches of policy-contingent debt measures were implemented following agreement by the Eurogroup in April and December 2019 respectively.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e125"><num>(3)</num><p>Greece has made a commitment in the Eurogroup to continue and complete all key reforms adopted under the European Stability Mechanism stability support programme (&apos;the programme&apos;) and to safeguard the objectives of the important reforms adopted under that programme and its predecessors. Greece has also committed to implement specific actions in the areas of fiscal and fiscal-structural policies, social welfare, financial stability, labour and product markets, privatisation and public administration. Those specific actions, which are set out in an annex to the Eurogroup statement of 22 June 2018, will contribute to addressing Greece&apos;s excessive macroeconomic imbalances and the sources or potential sources of economic difficulties.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e139"><num>(4)</num><p>On 27 February 2019, the Commission published the 2019 country report for Greece<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4"><p>SWD(2019) 1007 final.</p></authorialNote>. The Commission concluded that while Greece has successfully restored its budget balance and significantly narrowed the deficit in the current account, it is experiencing excessive macroeconomic imbalances<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5"><p>COM(2019) 150 final.</p></authorialNote> as a legacy of the crisis. These relate to the high public debt, the negative net international investment position, the high level of non-performing loans on banks&apos; balance sheets, and the still high unemployment rate. These findings were further confirmed by the Alert Mechanism Report, adopted by the Commission on 17 December 2019 on the basis of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6"><p>Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances (OJ L 306, 23.11.2011, p. 25).</p></authorialNote>, which identified Greece as one of the Member States for which an in-depth review would be carried out in 2020. In particular, the report shows that public debt in Greece stood at 181,2 % of Gross Domestic Product at the end of 2018, the highest level in the Union. The net international investment position of -143,3 % of Gross Domestic Product in 2018 remains very high, though this includes large external public debt at highly concessional terms. Moreover, in spite of the significant narrowing of the current account deficit, it still remains insufficient to support a reduction of the very large net international investment position at a satisfactory pace to bring it down to levels considered prudent. While unemployment has continued to decline from its peak of 27,8 % in 2013, it still stood at 16,6 % in October 2019. Long-term unemployment (12,1 % in the third quarter of 2019) and youth unemployment (35,6 % in October 2019) remain very high, though they have also declined substantially compared to their peaks during the crisis (long term unemployment had peaked at 19,9 % in the second quarter of 2014 and youth unemployment at 60,2 % in February 2013).</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e173"><num>(5)</num><p>In light of the Commission&apos;s 2019 in-depth review and on the basis of a Commission assessment, the Council examined the 2019 National Reform Programme and the 2019 Stability Programme.

The Council also recommended Greece to focus its investment-related economic policy in specific priority areas with a view to providing a solid underpinning for growth, while reducing regional disparities and ensuring social inclusion.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e189"><num>(6)</num><p>The Commission published its fourth assessment under enhanced surveillance on Greece<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8"><p>European Commission: Enhanced Surveillance Report &#45; Greece, November 2019, Institutional Paper 116, November 2019.</p></authorialNote> on 20 November 2019. It concluded that Greece has taken the necessary actions to achieve its specific reform commitments for mid-2019, but that further actions will be crucial to complete, and where necessary accelerate, reforms. This assessment took into account the efforts of the new administration over the preceding months to implement the commitments, in the context of advancing a broader reform agenda, and its willingness to prepare them in close cooperation with the institutions.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e202"><num>(7)</num><p>The authorities are in the process of catching up with the financial sector reforms but the plans will need to be firmed up going forward. The liquidity situation of Greek banks has further improved and there are signs that the banks&apos; market access is gradually re-established but legacy risks and challenges remain high. Their capital position remains adequate but may face near term pressures, for instance due to the gradual phasing out of transitional prudential arrangements. Banks still have to deal with a large stock of non-performing loans: Although the stock has been gradually declining from its peak of EUR 107,2 billion reached in March 2016, at end-September 2019, the stock was still very high at EUR 71,2 billion or 42,1 % of total on-balance-sheet gross customer loan exposures. The recently adopted Hercules asset protection scheme, once implemented, aims to facilitate a significant acceleration of the current strategies for the reduction of non-performing loans in the banking sector. Other challenges include the fragile profitability in the current low interest-rate environment and the strong sovereign-bank nexus, including through the high share of deferred tax credits in banks&apos; capital. The improving liquidity situation of Greek banks and increased depositor confidence led to the complete lifting of capital controls as of 1 September 2019.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e212"><num>(8)</num><p>Notwithstanding progress over the last years, Greece still faces major challenges with regard to its business environment and judicial system. Whilst Greece has made progress in areas such as reducing the time to register a business and strengthening the protection of minority investors, it still lags far behind the best-performance frontier in several areas of the structural components of leading comparative indicators (e.g. time to reach a judicial decision, enforcing contracts, registering property, resolving insolvency, etc.).</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e219"><num>(9)</num><p>After being cut off from financial market borrowing in 2010, Greece started to regain market access through issuances of government bonds as from July 2017. Greek government bond yields started to slowly moderate after the successful conclusion of the ESM programme in 2018 and declined significantly further in the second half of 2019, reaching record lows of 1,4 % on the 10-year tenure in December 2019, down from 4,3 % a year earlier. Greece&apos;s borrowing conditions nonetheless remain fragile against the background of external economic risks and domestic vulnerabilities. Greece has also benefited from upgrades from credit rating agencies but remains below investment grade.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e225"><num>(10)</num><p>In light of the above, the Commission concludes that the conditions justifying the establishment of enhanced surveillance pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 472/2013 are still present. In particular, Greece continues to face risks with respect to its financial stability which, if they materialise, could have adverse spill-over effects on other euro-area Member States. Should any spillover effects materialise, they could occur indirectly by impacting investor confidence and thus refinancing costs for banks and sovereigns in other euro-area Member States.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e231"><num>(11)</num><p>Therefore, over the medium term, Greece needs to continue adopting measures to address the sources or potential sources of difficulties and implementing structural reforms to support a robust and sustainable economic recovery, with a view to alleviate the legacy effects of several factors. These include the severe and protracted downturn during the crisis; the size of Greece&apos;s debt burden; its financial sector vulnerabilities; the continued relatively strong interlinkages between the financial sector and Greek public finances, including through State ownership; the risk of contagion of severe tensions in either of those sectors to other Member States, as well as euro-area Member States&apos; exposure to the Greek sovereign.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e237"><num>(12)</num><p>In order to address residual risks and monitor the fulfilment of the commitments geared thereto, it appears necessary and appropriate to prolong the enhanced surveillance of Greece pursuant to Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 472/2013.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d240e243"><num>(13)</num><p>Greece was given the opportunity to express its views on the assessment of the Commission, via a letter sent on 22 January 2020.
