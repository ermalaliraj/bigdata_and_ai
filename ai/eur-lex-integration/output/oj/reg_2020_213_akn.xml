The Authority also concluded that the additive does not have adverse effect on animal health and the environment. It was also concluded that the additive is a respiratory sensitiser and should be considered as a potential skin sensitiser. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effect on human health, in particular as regards the users of feed additives. The Authority also concluded that the additive is efficacious in improving digestibility of feed for chickens reared for laying or for breeding purposes, turkeys reared for breeding or breeding hens and suckling piglets. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d245e174"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of 3-phytase produced by <i>Aspergillus niger</i> (CBS 101.672) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
