Moreover, it is already integral to the existing testing methodology set out in the past approval Implementing Decisions that such effects may be taken into account, where necessary, by the requirement that the efficiency of the alternator must be measured at least five times. As the efficiency of alternators is determined on the basis of the average of the measurement results, any run-in effects, positive or negative, may therefore be adequately taken into account in the final efficiency determination, where necessary by increasing the number of measurements.
