The currently authorised level of &lt; 0,1 μg/g cadaverine in spermidine-rich wheat germ extract represents the limit of detection with the analytical method that the applicant had erroneously included in the initial notification as the specification limit for cadaverine, and which was subsequently included in the Union list specifications of this novel food.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d254e149"><num>(7)</num><p>Cadaverine is a diamine which together with histamine, tyramine, and putrescine belong to the class of the biogenic amines that are naturally formed as the result of bacterial metabolism of proteins.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d254e155"><num>(8)</num><p>The health risks of biogenic amines were evaluated by the European Food Safety Authority (&apos;the Authority&apos;) in 2011<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4"><p>EFSA Journal 2011;9(10):2393.</p></authorialNote>. In the scientific opinion, the Authority noted that analytical information and food consumption data from the Member States has shown that cadaverine is present in a number of foods (alcoholic beverages, condiments, fish and fish products, meats, dairy products, vegetables and vegetable products) at mean levels up to 184 mg/kg of food with the resulting intakes reaching up to 116,1 mg of cadaverine per day.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d254e170"><num>(9)</num><p>Considering that the proposed maximum levels of cadaverine in the novel food and the resulting intakes on the basis of the authorised conditions of use of the novel food will be at least three orders of magnitude lower than the levels of cadaverine that are ingested from a normal diet, the Commission considers that the proposed changes in the cadaverine levels in the specifications of the spermidine-rich wheat germ extract do not alter the safety considerations that supported the authorisation of this novel food, and that a safety evaluation of the current application by the Authority in accordance with Article 10(3) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 is not necessary.
