The Commission further considered that an exporting producer which is found to have breached the undertaking should not benefit from the variable duty MIP, even if these findings are made after the termination of the price undertaking. In those kind of cases, the variable duty MIP should no longer be applicable. The Commission should then remove the names of the respective company (ies) from the new Annex VI and the new Annex 5 by the same legal act in which the non-compliance is established.&apos;</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d255e1127"><num>(62)</num><p>In that regard, the Commission observed that it derives the power to invalidate undertaking invoices from Article 14 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 24 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.

The fact that the Commission did not become aware of that breach until after the repeal of those provisions by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1570 does not undermine the need for the effective application of those rules and the requirement to invalidate the invoices as of the point in time at which the breach occurred.
