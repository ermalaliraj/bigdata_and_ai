Consequently, the dose-effect relations introduced in Annex III to Directive 2002/49/EC should be based on those guidelines. In particular concerning the statistical significance, the WHO studies were based on representative populations, and the results of these assessment methods are consequently considered relevant when applied to representative populations.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d264e90"><num>(3)</num><p>Beyond the dose-effect relations developed in the context of the WHO, other studies might show different health effect sizes and other health effects, in particular concerning effects of road, railway and aircraft noise in local situations in specific countries. The alternative dose-effect relations established therein could be used provided that they are based on high quality and statistically significant studies.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d264e96"><num>(4)</num><p>Currently, limited knowledge is available on the harmful effects of industrial noise so that it is not possible to propose a common method for their assessment. Also, country specificities were not assessed in studies and therefore could not be included in this Annex. Likewise, while links between environmental noise and the following harmful effects were found, there is currently no sufficient evidence for determining a common method for the assessment of those harmful effects: stroke, hypertension, diabetes and other metabolic health outcomes, cognitive impairment in children, mental health and wellbeing, hearing impairment, tinnitus, adverse birth outcomes. Finally, while the link between railway noise and aircraft noise to the ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is established, for these two sources the quantification of the increased risk of IHD is premature.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d264e103"><num>(5)</num><p>Directive 2002/49/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d264e109"><num>(6)</num><p>The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 13 of Directive 2002/49/EC,</p></recital></recitals><formula name="enactingFormula"><p>HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:</p></formula></preamble><body><article xml:id="art_d264e118"><num>Article 1</num><heading/><paragraph><content><p>Annex III to Directive 2002/49/EC is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive.</p></content></paragraph></article><article xml:id="art_d264e123"><num>Article 2</num><heading/><paragraph><num>1.</num><subparagraph><content><p>Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 2021 at the latest.
