It also concluded that the additive is considered a skin and eye irritant and a skin and respiratory sensitiser. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive. The Authority also concluded that the additive is an efficacious source of selenium for ruminants. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the reports on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d268e114"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of sodium selenate shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
