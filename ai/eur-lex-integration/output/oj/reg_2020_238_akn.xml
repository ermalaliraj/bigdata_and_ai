It also stated that L-leucine produced by <i>Escherichia coli</i> NITE BP-02351 could pose an inhalation risk for the users of the additive. Therefore, appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d270e137"><num>(5)</num><p>The Authority concluded that it is an effective source of the amino acid L-leucine for all animal species. For the supplemental L-leucine to be fully efficacious in ruminants, it should be protected against degradation in the rumen. The Authority expressed in a previous statement a concern over potential nutritional imbalances for amino acids, when they are administered via water for drinking. However, the Authority did not propose a maximum content for L-leucine. Thus, it is appropriate to indicate on the label of the additive, and premixtures containing it, an alert to take into account the dietary supply with all the essential and conditionally essential amino acids, particularly in the case of supplementation with L-leucine as amino acid via water for drinking.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d270e143"><num>(6)</num><p>As regards the use of L-leucine as a flavouring, the Authority states that no further demonstration of efficacy is necessary when the substance is used at the recommended dose level. The use of L-leucine as a flavouring compound is not authorised in water for drinking. At the recommended dose, L-leucine as flavouring compound is not likely to pose any concern for the dietary supply with all the essential and conditionally essential amino acids.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d270e149"><num>(7)</num><p>The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring.
