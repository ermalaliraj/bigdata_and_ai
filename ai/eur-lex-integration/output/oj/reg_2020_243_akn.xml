The feedback loops enable reporting agents to obtain a more complete overview of the indebtedness of a debtor or prospective debtor as the information available is collected not only by the relevant NCB but also by other NCBs. The provision of credit data to NCBs to establish or enrich feedback loops to reporting agents will therefore enhance the contribution of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) to the stability of the financial system in line with its statutory mandate in accordance with Article 127(5) of the Treaty. While the number of NCBs initially participating in the feedback loop framework is limited, it may increase in the future as such participation is voluntary. In any case, the information made available through feedback loops on this initially limited scale remains crucial in preventing possible disruptions in the financial intermediation process as it enhances credit institutions&apos; credit risk analyses, in particular with regard to cross-border debtors, and thus ultimately contributes to financial stability.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d275e90"><num>(3)</num><p>Within the current legal framework, NCBs may, on a voluntary basis, exchange and use subsets of credit data for the purpose of providing reporting agents access to them via feedback loops. The ESCB has committed to updating the legal framework in order to further harmonise the feedback loops provided to reporting agents by NCBs.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d275e96"><num>(4)</num><p>It is therefore necessary to establish an appropriate framework for this activity, which is subject to the provisions of Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2016/867 (ECB/2016/13) regarding the rights and obligations of NCBs in relation to feedback loops. This framework should set out the obligations of the ECB and of the NCBs that participate in it (&apos;participating NCBs&apos;), including in the testing period prior to the date the individual NCBs start participating, taking into account the constraints linked to the confidential nature of the information and the time needed for implementation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d275e107"><num>(5)</num><p>For participating NCBs, the AnaCredit feedback loop framework, should also define the scope of data to be provided for feedback loop purposes in accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/867 (ECB/2016/13). In particular, it is necessary that credit data and related counterparty reference data are included within the scope in order to enable the reporting agents to better assess a debtor&apos;s creditworthiness.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d275e113"><num>(6)</num><p>The standards for the protection and use of confidential statistical information collected by the ESCB as laid down in Articles 8 to 8c of Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2"><p>Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank (OJ L 318, 27.11.1998, p. 8).</p></authorialNote> apply to the framework.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d275e129"><num>(7)</num><p>The NCBs that will participate in the feedback loop framework should be listed in an annex, together with the date from which they start participating and thus become participating NCBs. It is necessary to establish the procedure to be followed by an NCB which is not among the NCBs listed in the relevant annex and wishes to become a participating NCB, and the procedure for a participating NCB to terminate its participation. It is also necessary to establish the procedure to be followed where a participating NCB wishes to change the parameters for sharing the data in the table set out in the relevant annex. All such changes to that list (including to the date from which an NCB becomes a participating NCB) and table in the relevant annexes are to be made by means of technical amendments in accordance with Article 20 of Guideline (EU) 2017/2335 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2017/38)<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3"><p>Guideline (EU) 2017/2335 of the European Central Bank of 23 November 2017 on the procedures for the collection of granular credit and credit risk data (ECB/2017/38) (OJ L 333, 15.12.2017, p. 66).</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d275e145"><num>(8)</num><p>NCBs listed in the relevant annex should be able to test the necessary procedures prior to implementation.
