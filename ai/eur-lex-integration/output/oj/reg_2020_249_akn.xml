Such vehicles are thus required either to conform to the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) in force or be entitled not to apply those TSIs pursuant to Article 7(1) of that Directive. At the same time, one of the objectives of Directive (EU) 2016/797 is the streamlining and harmonisation of authorisation procedures at Union level to facilitate the free movement of vehicles. To this end, clause 7.6.1 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 321/2013<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2"><p>Commission Regulation (EU) No 321/2013 of 13 March 2013 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the subsystem &apos;rolling stock &#45; freight wagons&apos; of the rail system in the European Union and repealing Decision 2006/861/EC (OJ L 104, 12.4.2013, p. 1).</p></authorialNote> and clause 7.5.2.3 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1302/2014<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3"><p>Commission Regulation (EU) No 1302/2014 of 18 November 2014 concerning a technical specification for interoperability relating to the &apos;rolling stock &#45; locomotives and passenger rolling stock&apos; subsystem of the rail system in the European Union (OJ L 356, 12.12.2014, p. 228).</p></authorialNote> call for the development of flexibility provisions with regards to compliance with the TSI requirements. Those provisions are to set out which level of flexibility could be granted in case of extension of the area of use of vehicles placed in service before 15 June 2016, while fulfilling the essential requirements, maintaining the appropriate safety level, and where reasonably practicable, improving it. Those Regulations should therefore be amended accordingly. The provision related to &apos;extension of area of use&apos; also covers the case of vehicles needing modifications to ensure technical compatibility with the new network(s); in such case, the unchanged parts of the vehicle remain validated under the previous authorisation. Restrictions and limitations of previous authorisation continue to apply. For the same reasons, such clarification should also be provided for Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/919<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4"><p>Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/919 of 27 May 2016 on the technical specification for interoperability relating to the &apos;control-command and signalling&apos; subsystems of the rail system in the European Union (OJ L 158, 15.6.2016, p. 1).</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d281e133"><num>(2)</num><p>There are divergent approaches amongst notified bodies and authorising entities in the rail sector with regards to the application of the different transitional provisions set out in clauses 7.1.1.2 to 7.1.1.8 and clause 7.1.3.1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1302/2014. Similarly, there are divergent approaches in the rail sector with regards to the validity period of EC type or design examination certificates in case of changes to an existing rolling stock type, as set out in clause 7.2.2.2 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 321/2013 and clause 7.1.2.2 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1302/2014. In addition to this, further harmonisation reducing the divergences from the target system are essential to reduce the cost of railways and ensure their interoperability and competitiveness. The provisions listed above should thus be amended to avoid divergent application of those transition provisions and validity periods of certificates, while future transition periods should focus on specific requirements with high impact on ongoing projects instead of providing generic exemptions, in a way that will lead to timely reduction of the divergences from the target system while providing the predictability and legal certainty necessary to the sector. This should be achieved in the framework of the Digital rail and Green freight TSI revision package (2022 revision) for which the Commission sent a request to the European Union Agency for Railways on 24 January 2020.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d281e143"><num>(3)</num><p>Furthermore, Member States and the sector have identified some technical and editorial errors in some of these regulations, and the Slovak Republic has identified that the general specific case set out in section 7.3.2.1 of the Annex to Commission Regulations (EU) No 321/2013 (WAG TSI) should also apply to its 1520 mm track gauge network.
