Whilst it is true that the law does not have authority to apply selectively in favour of certain categories of undertakings or sectors of activity, it must be remembered that the debt remissions criticised by the Commission do not flow automatically from the application of the law, but from the discretionary decisions made by the public bodies in question. It is, moreover, settled case-law that where the body granting financial assistance enjoys a degree of latitude which enables it to choose the beneficiaries or the conditions under which the financial assistance is provided, that assistance cannot be considered to be general in nature (Case C-256/97 <i>DM Transport</i> [1999] ECR I-3913, paragraph 27).&apos;</quotedStructure></mod></p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d290e935"><num>(33)</num><p>The German authorities argue that, contrary to the measures at stake in <i>DM Transport</i> and <i>HAMSA</i>, § 8c(1a) KStG does not provide for discretionary decisions of public bodies, but that its application flows automatically from the law.

They claim that there is an objective difference between undertakings in difficulty which are in need of restructuring and other undertakings, and that this objective difference justifies a different treatment of undertakings in difficulty which are acquired in view of a restructuring. The German authorities base their argument on three considerations.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d290e980"><num>(37)</num><p>Firstly, they argue that whereas financially sound undertakings have a choice between financing themselves on capital markets and looking for another undertaking that may want to acquire them, undertakings in difficulty only have the latter option, i.e. to look for an acquirer, as they will not be able to raise debt on capital markets or obtain a bank loan. As a result, undertakings in difficulty will systematically loose the possibility to carry forward their losses, whereas healthy undertakings always have the choice between debt financing and the search for a buyer.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d290e986"><num>(38)</num><p>Secondly, they argue that the <i>ratio legis</i> of § 8c(1) KStG, that is to avoid trade in empty-shell companies with accumulated losses, does not require the exclusion of loss carry-forward in situations where the acquisition has the purpose of a restructuring, and not of pure fiscal optimisation. Without the limitation of § 8c(1a) KStG to acquisitions of undertakings in financial difficulty in view of restructuring, i.e. by including also other acquisitions, the <i>ratio legis</i> could no longer be realized.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d290e998"><num>(39)</num><p>Thirdly, they argue that the purpose of § 8c(1) KStG is to ensure that the sales price for participations in undertakings is based solely on the economic value of the undertaking, excluding the value of the accumulated losses for fiscal optimisation. In case of the acquisition of an undertaking in difficulty in view of restructuring, however, the possible value of accumulated losses plays, in the view of the German authorities, no particular role. To demonstrate this, they note that accountants do not give any value, in the books of a tax-consolidated entity, to possibly carried-forward losses of an ailing undertaking.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d290e1004"><num>(40)</num><p>For these three cumulative reasons, the German authorities consider that, even if § 8c(1a) KStG were <i>prima facie</i> selective, it is in any event justified by the nature and general scheme of taxation of corporate entities in Germany.</p></recital><num>4.4.</num><p>Link between new and old Sanierungsklausel</p><recital xml:id="rec_d290e1025"><num>(41)</num><p>The German authorities observe that § 8c KStG has replaced, as of 1 January 2008, a similar rule, namely § 8(4) KStG.

Second, it is in relation to this common or &apos;normal&apos; tax regime that it is necessary to assess and determine if any advantage granted by the tax measure at issue may be selective. This has to be done by demonstrating that the measure derogates from that common regime inasmuch as it differentiates between economic operators that, in the light of the objective pursued by that regime, are in a comparable factual and legal situation. Third, if such derogation exists, it is necessary to examine whether it results from the nature or general scheme of the taxation system of which it forms part and could hence be justified by the nature or logic of the system.
