The Annex to that Implementing Decision demarcates and lists certain areas of the Member States concerned in Parts I to IV thereof, differentiated by the level of risk based on the epidemiological situation as regards that disease. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU has been amended several times to take account of changes in the epidemiological situation in the Union as regards African swine fever that need to be reflected in that Annex.

In particular, Article 9 of Directive 2002/60/EC provides for the establishment of a protection zone and a surveillance zone when African swine fever has been officially confirmed in pigs on a holding, and Articles 10 and 11 of that Directive lay down the measures to be taken in the protection and surveillance zones in order to prevent the spread of that disease. Recent experience has shown that the measures laid down in Directive 2002/60/EC are effective in controlling the spread of that disease, and in particular the measures providing for the cleaning and disinfecting of infected holdings and other measures related to the eradication of that disease.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d303e143"><num>(3)</num><p>Since the date of adoption of Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/46, there have been new cases of African swine fever in feral pigs in Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.

Given that Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU lists the areas where the epidemiological situation is still evolving and very dynamic, when any amendments are made to areas listed in that Part, particular consideration must always be given to the effect on the surrounding areas, as has been done in this instance.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d303e159"><num>(5)</num><p>In late January 2020, one case of African swine fever in feral pigs was observed in the county of Kuldīga in Latvia in an area currently listed in Part II of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU, located in close proximity to an area listed in Part I thereof.
