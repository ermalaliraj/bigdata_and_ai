It was also authorised without a time limit as a feed additive for dogs and cats belonging to the group &apos;colourants, including pigments&apos;, under the heading &apos;colouring agents authorised for colouring foodstuffs by Community rules&apos;.

The applicant requested the additive to be classified in the additive category &apos;sensory additive&apos; and in the functional group &apos;colourants&apos;. In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the applicant also requested the authorisation of erythrosine as a feed additive for a new use in reptiles, to be classified in the additive category &apos;sensory additive&apos; and in the functional group &apos;colourants&apos;. Lately, the applicant withdrew the application for ornamental fish and for reptiles.

It also concluded that dermatological reactions, including photosensitivity, erythroderma and desquamation have been attributed to erythrosine and that an exposure of the lower respiratory tract is considered a hazard for the user of the additive. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive.

The Authority further concluded that the substance concerned is effective in adding colour to feedingstuffs and in favourably affecting the colour of ornamental fish. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d314e177"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of the erythrosine shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
