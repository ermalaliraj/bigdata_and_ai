The Authority also concluded that the additive is an efficacious source of the amino-acid L-threonine for all animal species and that in order to be as efficacious in ruminants as in non-ruminant species, the additive should be protected against degradation in the rumen. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d325e138"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of L-threonine produced by <i>Corynebacterium</i> glutamicum KCCM 80117 and by <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum</i> KCCM 80118 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
