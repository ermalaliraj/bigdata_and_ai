Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and exports to third countries.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d31e130"><num>(3)</num><p>Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d31e136"><num>(4)</num><p>In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept.
