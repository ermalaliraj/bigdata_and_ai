In its updated statement, the Authority confirmed its conclusions on the human health assessment that critical areas of concerns exist. A genotoxic potential of chlorpyrifos-methyl cannot be ruled out, when taking into account the concerns raised for chlorpyrifos and the available scientific open literature on chlorpyrifos-methyl in a weight of evidence approach. During the peer review, experts considered a read-across approach between the two substances justified as they are structurally similar and have similar toxicokinetic behaviour. Consequently, it is not possible to establish health-based reference values for chlorpyrifos-methyl and to conduct the relevant consumer and non-dietary risk assessments. Furthermore, concerns were identified concerning developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) for which epidemiological evidence exists, showing an association between exposure to chlorpyrifos and/or chlorpyrifos-methyl during development and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. Moreover, the peer review experts indicated that it may be appropriate to classify chlorpyrifos-methyl as toxic for reproduction, category 1B, in accordance with the criteria established under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="8"><p>Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (OJ L 353, 31.12.2008, p. 1).</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d34e222"><num>(11)</num><p>The Commission invited the applicants to submit their comments on the statements of the Authority.
