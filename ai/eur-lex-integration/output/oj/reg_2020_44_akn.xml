The Council is to exercise its policy-making and coordinating functions as provided for in Article 16(1) TEU by establishing the positions to be taken on the Union&apos;s behalf in the Joint committee and the specialised committees. Furthermore, where the Joint Committee is called upon to adopt acts having legal effects, the positions to be taken on the Union&apos;s behalf in the Joint Committee are to be established in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Six months before Article 5 of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland of the Withdrawal Agreement becomes applicable, the modalities for the participation of Member States in the meetings of the Joint Committee and the specialised committees will be reviewed, taking into account the new situation thus created.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d45e127"><num>(6)</num><p>It is recalled that several declarations were included in the minutes of the European Council of 25 November 2018.

Two other declarations of the European Council and of the Commission were included in the above minutes of the European Council: an interpretative declaration on Article 184 of the Withdrawal Agreement and a declaration on the territorial scope of the future agreements.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d45e136"><num>(7)</num><p>Where the Union is to take a position in the Joint Committee, the Council and the Commission are to respect the Declarations included in the minutes of the European Council of 25 November 2018.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d45e145"><num>(8)</num><p>The European Parliament is to be immediately and fully informed, as provided for in Article 218(10) TFEU, on the basis of practical modalities of cooperation allowing it to exercise fully its prerogatives in accordance with the Treaties.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d45e151"><num>(9)</num><p>Whenever the Union is required to act in order to comply with the provisions of the Agreement, such action is to be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Treaties, while respecting the limits of the powers conferred upon each institution.

It is also for the Commission to represent the Union before the arbitration panel where a dispute has been submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 170 of the Agreement. In compliance with the duty of sincere cooperation referred to in Article 4(3) TEU, the Commission is to consult the Council beforehand, for example by submitting to it the main lines of the intended Union submissions to the panel and taking into account comments made by the Council.

According to Article 26 of the Agreement, the Member State of work is to issue to United Kingdom nationals who have rights as frontier workers under the Agreement a document certifying their status of frontier worker under the Agreement. In order to ensure uniform conditions within the Union for the implementation of those provisions, with the aims of facilitating the recognition of such documents, in particular by border control authorities, and of preventing falsification and counterfeiting through high-level security features, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish the validity period, format of such documents and technical specifications for such documents, as well as the common statement that documents issued under Articles 18 and 26 of the Agreement are required to have, namely that they were issued in accordance with the Agreement.
