On 24 November 1997, Jordan signed the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part,<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="2"><p>OJ L 129, 15.5.2002, p. 3.</p></authorialNote> (the &apos;Association Agreement&apos;), which came into force on 1 May 2002. Under the Association Agreement, the Union and Jordan gradually established a Free Trade Area over a transitional period of 12 years. In addition, an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures and amending the EC-Jordan Association Agreement as well as replacing Annexes I, II, III and IV and Protocols 1 and 2 to that Agreement<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="3"><p>OJ L 41, 13.2.2006, p. 3.</p></authorialNote> entered into force in 2007. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the Union and Jordan that entails expanded areas of cooperation. A protocol between the European Union and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan establishing a dispute settlement mechanism applicable to disputes under the trade provisions of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part,<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="4"><p>OJ L 177, 6.7.2011, p. 3.</p></authorialNote> was initialled in December 2009 and entered into force on 1 July 2011.

A Constitutional Court and an Independent Election Commission have been set up and a number of major laws, including the Electoral Act and the Political Parties Act, as well as laws on decentralisation and municipalities, have been passed by the Jordanian Parliament. In addition, legislative improvements as regards the independence of the judiciary and women&apos;s rights have been adopted.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d54e122"><num>(3)</num><p>The Jordanian economy has suffered significantly from protracted conflicts in the region, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. That regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. Tourism and inflows of foreign direct investment have been negatively affected and trading routes have remained blocked for long periods. Separately, the flow of natural gas from Egypt was disrupted for several years, giving rise to a need to procure energy from alternative sources at a higher cost. In addition, the Jordanian economy has been impacted by a large inflow of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on Jordan&apos;s fiscal position, public services and infrastructure.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d54e129"><num>(4)</num><p>In August 2016, the Jordanian authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed on a second economic adjustment programme supported by a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in the amount of USD 723 million, which followed a USD 2000 million three-year Stand-By Arrangement running from 2012 to 2015.

MFA-II came as a follow-up to the commitment expressed at the conference &apos;Supporting Syria and the Region&apos;, held in London on 4 February 2016, where the Union pledged EUR 2390 million in 2016-2017 in financial support for the countries most affected by the refugee crisis, including Jordan. The Memorandum of Understanding defining the policy conditions related to MFA-II entered into force on 19 September 2017.

At the &apos;London Initiative&apos; conference, which took place in February 2019, and at the Brussels III conference held in March 2019, the international and regional donor community, including the Union, re-confirmed its intentions to support Jordan&apos;s efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability and enhance growth prospects.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d54e196"><num>(9)</num><p>Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2100 million to Jordan under different instruments, including EUR 380 million under the two macro-financial assistance programmes, to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address Jordan&apos;s humanitarian, development and security needs.
