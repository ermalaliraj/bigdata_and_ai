That concept is enshrined in the Chinese Constitution and determines the economic governance of the PRC. The core principle is the &apos;<i>socialist public ownership of the means of production, namely, ownership by the whole people and collective ownership by the working people</i>&apos;. The State-owned economy is the &apos;<i>leading force of the national economy</i>&apos; and the State has the mandate &apos;<i>to ensure its consolidation and growth</i>&apos;<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="10"><p>The Report p. 6-7.</p></authorialNote>. Consequently, the overall setup of the Chinese economy not only allows for substantial government interventions into the economy, but such interventions are expressly mandated. The notion of supremacy of public ownership over the private one permeates the entire legal system and is emphasised as a general principle in all central pieces of legislation. The Chinese property law is a prime example: it refers to the primary stage of socialism and entrusts the State with upholding the basic economic system under which the public ownership plays a dominant role. Other forms of ownership are tolerated, with the law permitting them to develop side by side with the State ownership<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="11"><p>The Report p. 10.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d55e697"><num>(32)</num><p>In addition, under Chinese law, the socialist market economy is developed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (&apos;CCP&apos;). The structures of the Chinese State and of the CCP are intertwined at every level (legal, institutional, personal), forming a superstructure in which the roles of CCP and the State are indistinguishable. Following an amendment to the Chinese Constitution in March 2018, the leading role of the CCP was given an even greater prominence by being reaffirmed in the text of Article 1 of the Constitution. Following the existing first sentence of the provision: &apos;[t]<i>he socialist system is the basic system of the People&apos;s Republic of China</i>&apos; a new second sentence was inserted which reads: &apos;[<i>t</i>]<i>he defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China</i>&apos;<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="12"><p>See http://en.pkulaw.cn/display.aspx?cgid=311950&amp;lib=law</p></authorialNote>. This illustrates the control of the CCP over the economic system of the PRC. This control is inherent to the Chinese system and goes beyond the situation customary in other countries where the governments exercise broad macroeconomic control within the boundaries of which free market forces are at play.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d55e726"><num>(33)</num><p>First, on the level of overall administrative control, the direction of the Chinese economy is governed by a complex system of industrial planning which affects all economic activities within the country. The totality of these plans cover a comprehensive and complex matrix of sectors and crosscutting policies and is present on all levels of government. Plans at provincial level are detailed while national plans set broader targets. Plans also specify the means to support the relevant industries/sectors as well as the timeframes in which the objectives need to be achieved. Some plans contain explicit output targets. Under the plans, individual industrial sectors and/or projects are singled out as (positive or negative) priorities in line with the government priorities and specific development goals are attributed to them (industrial upgrade, international expansion, etc.). The economic operators, private and State-owned alike, must effectively adjust their business activities according to the realities imposed by the planning system. Not only because of the binding nature of the plans but also because the relevant Chinese authorities at all level of government adhere to the system of plans and use their vested powers accordingly, economic operators are induced to comply with the priorities set out in the plans<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="13"><p>The Report, p. 41, 73-74.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d55e737"><num>(34)</num><p>Second, on the level of allocation of financial resources, the financial system of China is dominated by the State- owned commercial banks. Those banks, when setting up and implementing their lending policy need to align themselves with the government&apos;s industrial policy objectives rather than primarily assessing the economic merits of a given project (see also section 3.3.2.9 below)<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="14"><p>The Report, p. 120-121.</p></authorialNote>. The same applies to the other components of the Chinese financial system, such as the stock markets, bond markets, private equity markets etc. Even though of lesser significance than the banking sector, these parts of the financial sector are institutionally and operationally set up in a manner not geared towards maximising the efficient functioning of the financial markets but towards ensuring control and allowing intervention by the State and the CCP<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="15"><p>The Report, p. 122-135.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d55e751"><num>(35)</num><p>Third, on the level of regulatory environment, the interventions by the State into the economy take a number of forms. For instance, the public procurement rules are regularly used in pursuit of policy goals other than economic efficiency, thereby undermining market based principles in the area. The applicable legislation specifically provides that public procurement shall be conducted in order to facilitate the achievement of goals designed by State policies. However, the nature of these goals remains undefined, thereby leaving broad margin of appreciation to the decision-making bodies<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="16"><p>The Report, p. 167-168.</p></authorialNote>. Similarly, in the area of investment, the GOC maintains significant control and influence over destination and magnitude of both State and private investment. Investment screening as well as various incentives, restrictions, and prohibitions related to investment are used by authorities as an important tool for supporting industrial policy goals, such as maintaining State control over key sectors or bolstering domestic industry<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="17"><p>The Report, p. 169-170, 200-201.</p></authorialNote>.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d55e765"><num>(36)</num><p>In sum, the Chinese economic model is based on certain basic axioms which provide for and encourage manifold government interventions.

The State (and in many respects also the CCP) not only actively formulates and oversees the implementation of general economic policies by individual enterprises, but it also claims its rights to participate in their operational decision making. The elements that point to the existence of government control over enterprises in the peroxosulphates sector are further developed in section 3.1.2.4 below. With the high level of government control and intervention in the chemical sector as described below, even privately owned peroxosulphates producers are prevented from operating under market conditions.</p></recital><num>3.1.2.4.</num><p>Significant distortions according to Article 2(6a)(b), second indent of the basic Regulation: State presence in firms allowing the state to interfere with respect to prices or costs</p><recital xml:id="rec_d55e809"><num>(40)</num><p>The GOC is in position to interfere with prices and costs through State presence in firms. As provided for in the Chinese legislation, CCP cells in enterprises, state-owned and private alike, represent another channel through which the State can interfere with business decisions.

Most of the injury indicators showed a positive or stable trend. The fact that the Union industry benefited from the measures is illustrated, among others, by the high level of capacity utilisation, and the increase in cash-flow and return on investment. The imports from the PRC present on the Union market originate from the sole Chinese producer found not to be dumping in the original investigation. On the basis of the above, the Commission concluded that the Union industry did not suffer material injury within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation during the review investigation period.</p></recital><num>5.</num><p>LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF INJURY</p><recital xml:id="rec_d55e3050"><num>(132)</num><p>In accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined next the likelihood of material injury to recur should measures against the PRC be allowed to lapse.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d55e3056"><num>(133)</num><p>The following elements were analysed: the production capacity and spare capacities in the PRC, the attractiveness of the Union market, including considerations on the existence of anti-dumping or countervailing measures on peroxosulphate in other third countries, the price behaviour of Chinese exporting producers in other third country markets, and the effect on the Union industry&apos;s situation.</p></recital><num>5.1.</num><p>Production capacity and spare capacities in the PRC</p><recital xml:id="rec_d55e3071"><num>(134)</num><p>The PRC is by far the largest global exporter of the product under review in the world.

Furthermore, as shown in Table 1 above, Union consumption of the product concerned increased 8 % between 2015 and the RIP. This shows that Union consumption remains strong and is increasing.

These calculations showed that the Chinese export prices are 26 % below the selling prices of the Union producers when comparing at the same level. The same analysis was performed on the basis of all Chinese export prices as reported to third countries (Union excluded) in the Global Trade Atlas. These calculations showed that the Chinese export prices are 18 % below the selling prices of the Union producers when comparing at the same level.

Therefore, the continuation of measures would benefit the Union industry because the Union producers should be able to maintain its sales volumes, market share, profitability and its overall positive economic situation. By contrast, the discontinuation of the measures could threaten the viability of the Union industry because there are reasons to expect a shift of the Chinese imports to the Union market at dumped prices and in considerable volumes that would cause recurrence of injury.</p></recital><num>7.</num><p>INTEREST OF USERS</p><recital xml:id="rec_d55e3239"><num>(147)</num><p>None of the contacted users provided a questionnaire reply.

However, this increase in sales price was linked to an equivalent increase in the cost of production (see recital (125)). Concerning import prices and volumes from the PRC, the Commission recalled that virtually all imports to the Union from the PRC originated from the exporter that was found not to be dumping in the original investigation, and which is not subject to the current review. In addition, imports from other third countries were made at prices comparable to the Union industry prices, and showed an increasing rather than a declining trend. The investigation also revealed that due to the nature of the product as well as the several sources of supplies available on the market users can easily switch suppliers.
