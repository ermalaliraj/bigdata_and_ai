It also concluded that the substance is mildly irritating to eyes and a skin sensitiser. In addition, given that the exposure to sodium formate via inhalation is considered to present a risk to unprotected workers handling the additive, it is prudent to consider it as a respiratory irritant. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards to users of the additive. The Authority also concluded that sodium formate liquid has the potential to be efficacious as hygiene condition enhancer in feedingstuffs. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the methods of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d82e122"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of sodium formate shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
