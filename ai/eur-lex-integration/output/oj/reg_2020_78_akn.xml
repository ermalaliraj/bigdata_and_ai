The Annex to that Implementing Decision demarcates and lists certain areas of the Member States concerned in Parts I to IV thereof, differentiated by the level of risk based on the epidemiological situation as regards that disease. The Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU has been amended several times to take account of changes in the epidemiological situation in the Union as regards African swine fever that need to be reflected in that Annex.

Taking into account the current epidemiological situation in the Union, regionalisation in those four Member States has been reassessed and updated. In addition, the risk management measures in place also have been reassessed and updated. These changes also need to be reflected in the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d99e133"><num>(3)</num><p>In December 2019, one case of African swine fever in a feral pig was observed in the province of Luxembourg in Belgium in an area currently listed in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU. This case of African swine fever in a feral pig constitutes an increased level of risk, which should be reflected in that Annex. Accordingly, this area of Belgium listed in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU affected by this recent case of African swine fever should now be listed in Part II of that Annex instead of in Part I thereof.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d99e139"><num>(4)</num><p>In January 2020, a few new cases of African swine fever in feral pigs were observed in the districts of Plungės and Skuodo in Lithuania in areas currently listed in Part II of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU, located in close proximity to areas listed in Part I thereof. These cases of African swine fever in feral pigs constitute an increased level of risk, which should be reflected in that Annex. Accordingly, these specific areas of Lithuania listed in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU that are in close proximity to areas listed in Part II affected by these recent cases of African swine fever should now be listed in Part II of that Annex instead of in Part I thereof.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d99e145"><num>(5)</num><p>In January 2020, several new cases of African swine fever in feral pigs were observed in the districts of zielonogórski and wschowski in Poland in areas currently listed in Part II of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU, located in close proximity to areas listed in Part I thereof. These cases of African swine fever in feral pigs constitute an increased level of risk, which should be reflected in that Annex. Accordingly, these areas of Poland listed in Part I of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU that are in close proximity to areas listed in Part II affected by these recent cases of African swine fever should now be listed in Part II of that Annex instead of in Part I thereof.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d99e151"><num>(6)</num><p>In January 2020, several outbreaks of African swine fever were observed in domestic pigs in the regions of Gabrovo and Sliven in Bulgaria in an area currently listed in Part II of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU, and in the region of Varna in an area currently listed in Part III located in close proximity to areas listed in Part II thereof. These outbreaks of African swine fever in domestic pigs constitute an increased level of risk, which should be reflected in that Annex. Accordingly, that area of Bulgaria currently listed in Part II that is affected by outbreaks, and that area currently listed in Part II that is in close proximity to the area listed in Part III affected by outbreaks, should now be listed in Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU instead of in Part II thereof. Given that Part III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU lists the areas where the epidemiological situation is still evolving and very dynamic, when any amendments are made to areas listed in that Part, particular consideration must always be given to the effect on the surrounding areas, as has been done in this instance.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d99e157"><num>(7)</num><p>In order to take account of recent developments in the epidemiological evolution of African swine fever in the Union, and in order to combat the risks associated with the spread of that disease in a proactive manner, new high-risk areas of a sufficient size should be demarcated for Belgium, Lithuania, Poland and Bulgaria and duly listed in Parts I, II and III of the Annex to Implementing Decision 2014/709/EU.
