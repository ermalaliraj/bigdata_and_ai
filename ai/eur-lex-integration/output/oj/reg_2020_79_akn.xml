Infections with avian influenza viruses in birds cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and exports to third countries.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d100e95"><num>(2)</num><p>Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d100e101"><num>(3)</num><p>In the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a Member State there is a risk that the disease agent may spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept.

That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. This regionalisation is applied in particular to preserve the health status of birds in the remainder of the territory of the Member State concerned by the outbreak by preventing the introduction of the pathogenic agent and ensuring the early detection of the disease.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d100e123"><num>(5)</num><p>In December 2019 and January 2020, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and
