It assessed whether there are critical circumstances where, for the subsidised product in question, injury which is difficult to repair is caused by massive imports in a relatively short period of a product benefitting from countervailable subsidies and whether it is deemed necessary to assess countervailing duties retroactively on those imports in order to preclude the recurrence of such injury.</p></recital><num>3.1.</num><p>Products benefitting from countervailing subsidies</p><recital xml:id="rec_d101e249"><num>(9)</num><p>As regards subsidisation, the Commission has at its disposal sufficient evidence that imports of the product concerned from the PRC and Egypt are being subsidised. The alleged subsidies consist, inter alia, of: direct transfers of funds within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(i) of the Basic Regulation; government revenue forgone or not collected, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation; and the provision of goods and services at less than adequate remuneration, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(iii) of the basic Regulation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e255"><num>(10)</num><p>It is alleged that those measures are subsidises since they involve a financial contribution from the Governments of the PRC and Egypt or other regional and local governments (including public bodies) and confer a benefit to the exporting producers of the product concerned. They are alleged to be contingent upon export performance and/or the use of domestic over imported goods and/or are limited to certain sectors and/or types of enterprises and/or locations, and are therefore specific and countervailable.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e261"><num>(11)</num><p>The evidence of subsidisation was made available in the open version of the complaint and was further analysed in the memorandum on sufficiency of evidence.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e267"><num>(12)</num><p>Therefore, the available evidence at this stage tends to indicate that the exports of the product concerned are benefiting from countervailable subsidies.</p></recital><num>3.2.</num><p>Injury which is difficult to repair</p><recital xml:id="rec_d101e282"><num>(13)</num><p>The request for registration provides sufficient evidence of critical circumstances, where for the product concerned injury, which is difficult to repair, is caused by massive imports benefiting from countervailable subsidies in a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, in the second request for registration the complainant argued that the Union GFF industry is currently in the process of negotiating 2020 contracts with Union customers and that immediate registration is essential for them not to lose a large part of their 2020 business to the subsidised products.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e289"><num>(14)</num><p>The Commission has sufficient evidence that the exporting producers&apos; subsidization is causing material injury to the Union industry, which is difficult to repair. This evidence consists of detailed data, contained in the complaint and in the latest request for registration concerning the key injury factors set out in Article 8(4) of the basic Regulation. Evidence of such circumstances includes the rapid deterioration of the situation of the Union industry characterized by depressed profit margins that halved between 2015 and 30 September 2018 as well as a loss of market share of 5 percentage points during the same period. This deterioration coincided with the increased volume of imports from the PRC and Egypt and a decrease of their average import price by 13,5 %, that, between 1 October 2017 and 30 September 2018 was significantly undercutting Union industry&apos;s prices by 37 % in case of the PRC and 26 % in case of Egypt, according to the complaint.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e304"><num>(15)</num><p>In addition, the Commission assessed whether the injury suffered was difficult to repair. Considering that the most important high volume users of GFF use lengthy processes to certify their suppliers, once they switch to a Chinese or Egyptian supplier it is unlikely for them to switch back to a Union producer in the short or even medium term. Such threat of permanent loss of market share or reduced income constitutes an injury which is difficult to repair. Furthermore, as argued in the second request for registration there is a clear risk that without action measures imposed in 2020, if any, would have been rendered ineffective to a significant extent with regard to 2020 market demand.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e310"><num>(16)</num><p>One exporting producer, one user and the China Chamber Of Commerce for Import &amp; Export of Light Industrial Products &amp; Arts-Crafts (&apos;CCCLA&apos;) argued that the imports in question are not likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the definitive duty as the average unit price of imports had increased from 2018 to 2019.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e320"><num>(17)</num><p>However, according to Eurostat, adjusted according to the methodology explained in recitals (21) to (24) below, the Commission found that the average unit price of GFF from the PRC and Egypt has dropped from 1,78 EUR/kg in 2015 to 1,54 EUR/kg in the investigation period of this investigation (1 January to 31 December 2018) (&apos;the investigation period&apos;). After the initiation of the investigation, between the end of February 2019 and September 2019, the unit price went up to 1,57 EUR/kg; however, this is still lower than the average unit price in 2015, 2016 or 2017 and significantly below the non-injurious price established in the complaint. These parties did not explain how in the view of the evidence contained in the complaint that increase of unit price would make the imports in questions not likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of the definitive duty. This claim was therefore rejected.</p></recital><num>3.3.</num><p>Massive imports in a relatively short period of time</p><recital xml:id="rec_d101e345"><num>(18)</num><p>In the request for registration the complainant used Eurostat import statistics in order to demonstrate the magnitude of imports from the PRC and Egypt and how their average import price developed.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e351"><num>(19)</num><p>One exporting producer, one user and the CCCLA argued that the request did not provide sufficient evidence required by Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation by wrongly adjusting and comparing the most recent import data to previous import statistics to show an increase of imports. They further argued that import data from China and Egypt should be analysed separately.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e357"><num>(20)</num><p>The Commission noted that the request for registration, based on the data available to the complainant at the time of filing, contained sufficient evidence to justify such action. Also, the Commission noted that there is no provision in the basic Regulation stating that the data from each country should be analysed separately in cases where the subject imports are cumulated in accordance with Article 8(3) of the basic Regulation. In any case, for its analysis the Commission relied on its own data and not those provided by the complainant, and the data was analysed for both countries separately and cumulatively.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e363"><num>(21)</num><p>The Commission found two specific issues that affect the methodology used to analyse the statistics in view of determining the value and volume of the GFF imported from the PRC and Egypt. The first relates to the CN codes, which the Commission took into consideration. The second issue relates to the TARIC codes, which the Commission considered under the relevant CN codes when analysing the data after initiation of the current investigation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e370"><num>(22)</num><p>When it comes to the classification, the complainant argued that the vast majority of GFF is classified only under CN codes 70193900 and 70194000 (&apos;the two relevant CN codes&apos;), whereas imports under CN codes 70195900 and 70199000 mainly include other products, thus they were not analysed in the complaint. Nevertheless, the complainant believed that the some imports of GFF may be declared under those codes and therefore they considered it necessary to include them in order to cover all imports of the product concerned. The Commission therefore initiated the case indicating all four CN codes under the product description in the Notice of initiation.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e393"><num>(23)</num><p>When analysing the imports, the complainant argued that the two most relevant CN codes also cover products other than GFF. Therefore, according to the complainant it was necessary to adjust the raw Eurostat data based on the market intelligence of the complainant and the companies supporting the complaint. The adjustment was relatively minor in the case of the PRC and unnecessary in the case of Egypt. The complainant&apos;s estimates were confirmed by the replies received from exporting producers to the sampling forms and to the questionnaire.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d101e399"><num>(24)</num><p>Pursuant to Article 24(5a) of the basic Regulation, at initiation, the Commission created specific TARIC codes under each of the four CN codes for GFF<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="5"><p>TARIC codes 7019390080; 7019400080; 7019590080; 7019900080.</p></authorialNote>. However, the investigation has shown that after the initiation of the investigation, importers of GFF predominantly used residual (&apos;catch-all&apos;) TARIC codes under the two relevant CN codes<authorialNote placement="bottom" marker="6"><p>TARIC codes 7019390085; 7019400085.</p></authorialNote> rather than the specific TARIC codes created for GFF.
