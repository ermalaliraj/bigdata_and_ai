It also concluded that the substance should be regarded as an inhalation hazard for the user of the additive and that in absence of data on skin and eye irritancy it could be considered as being potentially irritating to skin and/or eyes. Therefore, the Commission considers that appropriate protective measures should be taken to prevent adverse effects on human health, in particular as regards the users of the additive.

The Authority further concluded that the additive concerned is effective in adding colour to feedingstuffs. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.</p></recital><recital xml:id="rec_d111e143"><num>(5)</num><p>The assessment of brilliant blue FCF shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
