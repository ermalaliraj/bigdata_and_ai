# Latent Dirichlet Allocation 

Divide documents by topic they talk too. 

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
`Latent Dirichlet Allocation`  is a machine that produces documents.

### Data Pre-processing
- __Tokenization__: Split the text into sentences and the sentences into words. Lowercase the words and remove punctuation.
- Words that have fewer than 3 characters are removed.
- All stopwords are removed.
- __lemmatization__: words in third person are changed to first person and verbs in past and future tenses are changed into present.
- __stemmed__: words are reduced to their root form.
