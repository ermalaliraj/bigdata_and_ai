Familia trip.
I like this hotel a lot. The location, the food, room service and all the personal is great!  IÕve stayed in a suite with a city view.
And also in a standard room with the river view which is beautiful!Even though now they are remodeling the
hotel, we had a pleasant stay. They made us feel at home. I canÕt wait to see it finished!
