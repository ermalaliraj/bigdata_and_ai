### Libraries used in Python examples
- `NumPy` fundamental package for scientific computing. Well documented.
- `pandas` provides high performance, easy to use data structures and data analysis tools (data frame). 
Less [documented](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html)
- `matplotlib` used for 2d plotting
- `SciPy` used for scientific computing
- `scikit` tool used for data mining and data analysis. Lots of algorithms implemented using NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib.
- `scikit learn` provide an unified API for the basic tasks in machine learning and deep learning. 
Contains basic artificial neural networks.
- `TensorFlow` [TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) machine learning and artificial intelligence library which can run in GPU (multiple CPUs)
- `pycaret` [pycaret](https://pycaret.org/) is a low code machine learning.
- `statsmodels` provides classes and functions for many statistical models. 
Used for statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. (not used)
